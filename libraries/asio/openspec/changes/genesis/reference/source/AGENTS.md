# Working on asio

webcpp's rules apply here: read the superproject's
[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)
(<https://github.com/webcpporg/webcpp/blob/main/AGENTS.md>) first. This file
holds only what is specific to asio.

## What asio is

A library of webcpp's own on Boost.Asio, not a port: `meta/libraries.json`
has `"port-of": null`, and asio has no oracle, no twins and no "Differences"
appendix. Its page, `doc/asio.adoc`, with the Doc Comments of its headers,
and its specification are what a change is checked against.

Natively asio is Boost.Asio itself. On emscripten it is still Boost.Asio's
own `io_context`, whose `run` suspends into the browser's event loop, and
asio adds only what Boost lacks there: the configuration Asio needs to
build, a run family that yields to the page after every turn of
`max_handlers_per_turn` handlers, and a bridge through which browser events
reach the `io_context`.

## Cautions

- **Asyncify's stack is measured, not guessed.** `-sASYNCIFY_STACK_SIZE`
  is 8192 unless a program raises it with `<asyncify-stack-size>`, declared
  in `build.jam`: twice 4096, the smallest power of two with which every
  test passed in every build b2 links today (2026-10-11, Emscripten 6.0.11).
  The deepest is release, compiled with `-O3` and linked without
  optimization, as b2's emscripten toolset links it: 3,540 bytes in
  `bridge_asyncify`, against 1,272 in a debug build. Linked with `-O3`, the
  deepest test wrote 416 and the run family's deepest path 384, against
  2,404 linked without. The asyncify lane builds debug alone, so the
  measurement covers the other builds itself: the bytes are read from
  Asyncify's own data when an unwind stops, and `asyncify_stack` does it in
  debug, release and release linked with `-O3`, for every suspension of the
  run family, failing when one leaves less than half of the stack. A change
  that adds a way to suspend (a coroutine's, a promise's) measures it there,
  and a test that overflows traps with `RuntimeError: unreachable`, every
  time. When b2's release link gets its `-O`, measure again: the deepest
  build becomes debug's.
- **The run family is called on `main`'s stack alone**, or on the stack of
  another export the program lists for suspension. Anywhere else its first
  suspension fails: under JSPI it throws a `SuspendError`, and under
  Asyncify it starts an unwind that corrupts a suspended `main`. Nothing in
  asio, and nothing in a library built on it, calls `run`, `run_one`,
  `poll` or `dispatch` from a JavaScript event: a library is given an
  executor, and a program's own `run` says why after `lint-run:`.
- **The bridge only posts.** Delivering a browser event looks its
  registration up and posts its handler to the `io_context`; it never polls,
  runs or dispatches. While `run` is suspended, an event sees
  `running_in_this_thread()` true, so a `dispatch` there would run its
  handler inside the event, on the wrong stack; and under Asyncify a wake
  must come from JavaScript with no compiled code on the stack, which only a
  post gives.
- **A test ends with `webcpp::test::exit_status(...)`**: every test's `main`
  returns `webcpp::test::exit_status(boost::report_errors())`, from the
  superproject's `<webcpp/test/exit_status.hpp>`. Under Asyncify a `main`
  that suspended and then returns a failure exits 0, and one that never
  finishes exits 0 on both variants; the superproject's test support fails a
  test whose `main` did not finish, and `exit_status` is how a `main` tells
  it that it did, and with which status. A test that returns
  `boost::report_errors()` alone reads as passed whatever it found.
- **Two translation units under `src/`.** asio is header-only but for
  `src/browser_src.cpp`, the JavaScript of the yield, of the bridge and of
  the promises, and the export the bridge delivers through, which the usage
  requirements of `/webcpp/asio//asio` link on emscripten; and
  `src/cobalt_main.cpp`, webcpp's definition of Boost.Cobalt's
  `run_main`, which gives `co_main` the turn limit and which
  `/webcpp/asio//cobalt` links. A program never compiles either itself: the
  targets link each once, and a second definition fails at link.
