## Context

webcpp::asio is a header-only C++20 wrapper over Boost.Asio for two targets, native and
Emscripten. Its specification was written on 2026-10-10 from an independent review whose probes
(built with em++ 6.0.11 and run with node 26.7.0) measured how Boost.Asio already behaves on
Emscripten (`reference/spec.md`), approved by the owner on 2026-10-11, and turned into a plan of
24 tasks, 0 to 23 (`reference/plan.md`), whose five departures from the spec the owner approved
the same day. Tasks 1 and 4 to 9 are implemented in a local, unpublished repository; this
document is the approved design in OpenSpec's form.

Constraints every decision below works within, from the superproject's rulebook (its
`AGENTS.md`):

- header-only C++20, namespace `webcpp::asio`, headers under `<webcpp/asio/...>`, internals in
  `detail`, macros `WEBCPP_ASIO_*`, include guards `WEBCPP_ASIO_<HEADER>_HPP`, the b2 target
  `/webcpp/asio//asio`, the error category `webcpp.asio`;
- the library is built for native and Emscripten and has no WASI target; every test runs on each
  target its Jamfile names, with exceptions on and off, in both suspension variants;
- errors as values (`boost::system::error_code`); an API that throws sits behind
  `WEBCPP_ASIO_NO_EXCEPTIONS` and raises through `boost::throw_exception`;
- run-time objects allocate through the user's allocator; no global or static mutable state in
  the library;
- every line that names Boost.Asio, a clock, a timer or `this_thread::` says why after
  `lint-world:`, and every call of the run family says why after `lint-run:`;
- Boost and std before custom code; no new third-party code; BSL-1.0, "Copyright (c) 2026
  WebCpp.org" on every source file; English; no em dash.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- A program written against Boost.Asio, `main()` and `io_context::run()` included, runs unchanged
  in a browser; its code runs only when the browser delivers an event, never by polling, and its
  stack and objects stay as they were.
- Natively, webcpp::asio is Boost.Asio itself and costs nothing.
- On Emscripten, add only what Boost lacks: the threads configuration, a reactor made at
  construction, a limit on the handlers one turn runs, and a bridge from browser events to
  `post`.
- Both suspension variants (JSPI and Asyncify) built from the same sources, tested, sized, and
  picked at load time.
- Boost.Cobalt, Boost.Beast (through webcpp::beast) and any library on Asio's model run on it
  unchanged.
- The browser's promises and events as Asio operations, with every completion token.
- What a browser cannot do (TCP, UDP, name resolution) compiles and fails as a value.

**Non-Goals:**

- A WASI backend (`wasi:io/poll`, p3's async): a later increment with its own specification.
- WebSocket and HTTP clients (webcpp::beast), WebRTC (webcpp::webrtc), relay transports and the b2
  feature that enables one, trystero's migration, and offering the additions upstream to
  Boost.Asio.
- Polling the page from C++, running the run family from a JavaScript event, or blocking the
  page's thread without suspending.
- A thread pool: the page has no threads (`BOOST_ASIO_DISABLE_THREADS`).

## Decisions

### D1. A class derived from Boost's io_context, and every other name Boost's

`webcpp::asio::io_context` derives from `boost::asio::io_context` on both targets, shares its
executor type and converts to `boost::asio::io_context&`; the timers are aliases of Boost's; a
program keeps naming `post`, `co_spawn`, `use_awaitable` and `bind_executor` from Boost.

- **Why:** a program sets its options the same way everywhere, and code written against either
  interoperates; Cobalt and Beast are templates over Boost's executor.
- **Alternatives:** a fork of Asio's scheduler (a maintenance burden and incompatible with
  every library on Asio); a free function that runs a Boost context (nowhere to keep the
  options).

### D2. The run family is a composition of Boost's calls

Boost's `run` is not virtual and cannot be told to yield, so on Emscripten the six members hide
Boost's and compose `poll_one` and `run_one`: a turn of ready handlers, return if stopped or
expired, yield through a macrotask if the turn reached the limit, else `run_one` (which suspends
in the reactor's `select`). Natively they are Boost's own through `using` declarations.

- **Why:** measured, a self-posting handler ran 300,000 times under Boost's `run` before a
  `setTimeout(0)` ran, because a zero-timeout `select` suspends only to a microtask.
- **Consequence:** code that calls `run` through a `boost::asio::io_context&` gets Boost's run
  without the limit (documented); Cobalt's `co_main` gets the limit by D11.

### D3. The yield is a MessageChannel macrotask, the limit 1000

The yield is an `EM_ASYNC_JS` import whose promise a `MessageChannel` message resolves. The
default `max_handlers_per_turn` is 1000 (measured: the `setTimeout(0)` ran at iteration 1,000
under JSPI and 999 under Asyncify); 0 is taken as 1; a program changes it at construction or
later. A deadline is checked before each handler, so a passed deadline runs nothing and a
self-posting handler cannot outrun `run_for`.

- **Why:** a macrotask lets the browser render, run timers and deliver events; `MessageChannel`
  exists in node and in every browser. The default is to be measured again in the browser lane
  against a frame's budget (the plan's stop rule: a 95th percentile above 8 ms stops the work
  for the owner's decision).

### D4. JSPI and Asyncify are build variants, a composite propagated feature

`webcpp-suspend` (`jspi` default, `asyncify`) is propagated, so every library a program uses is
built for its variant, and composite because Asyncify traps at run time with WebAssembly
exceptions: `asyncify` composes `<exception-handling-method>js`. `jspi` links `-sJSPI`,
`asyncify` `-sASYNCIFY`; a build with `exception-handling=off` compiles `-fno-exceptions` on both.
A non-default variant builds in a directory of its own.

- **Why:** the owner decided (2026-10-10) that the variant is chosen at build time and the
  developer ships the artifact a page's loader picks for its browser. A usage requirement
  cannot do it, because b2 takes only free features from usage requirements.
- **Alternatives:** JSPI only (excludes browsers without it); a run-time switch (the two
  differ in compiler instrumentation, so they cannot share an artifact).

### D5. Asyncify's stack is measured, 8192 bytes, raised by a feature

`-sASYNCIFY_STACK_SIZE` is 8192 unless a program asks for more with `asyncify-stack-size`
(propagated, powers of two from 8192 to 1048576; smaller values are declared only to be refused
by an `#error` of `config.hpp`). The size is twice the deepest suspension the tests reach in
any build b2 links today (3,540 bytes in a release build linked without optimization, measured
2026-10-11). `asyncify_stack` reads the bytes each unwind wrote from Asyncify's own data and
fails when a suspension of the run family leaves less than half the stack. The asio flag ends
last on emcc's line, where emcc keeps the last.

- **Why:** a suspension that does not fit traps with `RuntimeError: unreachable`, certain at
  every suspension that deep; Emscripten's default (4096) left 556 bytes in the deepest build.
- **Open point:** when b2's release link gets its `-O`, measure again.

### D6. The reactor is made at construction

With threads disabled, a `run` that has work but no reactor waits in `null_event::do_wait`,
`::pause()`, which nothing wakes (measured). The io_context holds one unarmed
`boost::asio::steady_timer`, through public API, so the reactor exists from construction and
`run` suspends in `select`, which a post wakes.

### D7. The bridge only posts

Every event source is a JavaScript function made by the io_context's bridge, a service of the
context (made with its allocator, shut down and destroyed with it), registered by a key that is
never reused (a `std::uint64_t` from 1, held in JavaScript as a `BigInt`). Delivering looks the
key up and posts; it never polls, runs or dispatches: while `run` is suspended an event sees
`running_in_this_thread()` true and a `dispatch` would run its handler on the event's stack, and
calling the run family there fails at its first suspension (a `SuspendError` under JSPI, a
corrupted `main` under Asyncify).

- **JavaScript boundary:** the bridge's functions keep what must hold however a delivery ends,
  because a JavaScript error passes every C++ `catch` and skips frames' epilogues (and their
  destructors outside WebAssembly exceptions): the stack pointer (`stackSave`/`stackRestore`),
  the count of deliveries in progress (`delivering()` reads it), and the event's handle (C++ only
  borrows it, through a union that never destroys the `val`). A C++ exception is caught in C++,
  which frees it. A trap (`WebAssembly.RuntimeError`, which `abort()` throws too) goes on to the
  page; `ExitStatus` and `'unwind'` end the delivery unreported; after `ABORT` nothing enters
  WebAssembly.
- **No public way around it:** `deliver` is private (the export is a friend), `delivering()`
  takes no value, pinned by compile-fail tests.

### D8. Detection by a flag and by the bridge's count

Each of the six members admits once, first (`BOOST_ASSERT_MSG`, returning 0 and running nothing
when assertions are off), then calls only private unchecked code, never another public member.
A flag scope puts back the value it found, so an inner scope never clears an outer one's flag
and a C++ exception clears it on its way out. Four calls go undetected and are documented.

- **A JavaScript error out of a handler** skips destructors in the Asyncify and no-exception
  builds and leaves Boost's own state broken (its work count, its call stack); asio does not put
  its flag back, because no boundary can restore Boost's state and a recovered flag would trade
  a reported refusal for a run that never returns. Handlers catch JavaScript errors in
  JavaScript. Measured in all four builds on 2026-10-11.
- `admitted()` is not `noexcept`: whether the bridge delivers is read from JavaScript.

### D9. A test ends as its `main` ends, in the build, not in each library

Under node a `main` that suspended and returns non-zero exits 0 under Asyncify, and a `main` that
never finishes exits 0 on both variants. The superproject's test support (`node-pre.js`, linked
by every `webcpp.run`, `run-fail` and `example`) makes a test whose `main` did not finish fail,
keeps the first status given to `webcpp::test::exit_status`, and stops a test past its bound
(120 s by default). Every test ends with `return webcpp::test::exit_status(boost::report_errors());`.

### D10. Artifacts named Boost's way, a manifest, and a loader

b2 separates builds by directory and an artifact's name carries its tags joined by `-`
(`app-60-d-jspi.js`, `.../webcpp-suspend-asyncify/app-60-d-asyncify.js`). `webcpp.variants`
builds both variants of a page program and `<name>.variants.json`, which
`webcpp-asio-loader.mjs` reads (never a pattern): `supportsJspi`, `pick`, `load`. `webcpp.size-table`
records the size of each variant of each example (Asyncify's program is about 2.9 times JSPI's).

### D11. Cobalt's `run_main` is webcpp's, built from Cobalt's sources

Cobalt's `co_main` cannot be replaced from a header: `main` is a hidden friend that calls
`main_promise::run_main`, compiled in Cobalt's `src/main.cpp`, which owns an `io_context` and
calls Boost's `run`. webcpp compiles every Cobalt source but `main.cpp` (and, departure 3,
`io/ssl.cpp`) as `/webcpp//boost_cobalt` and defines `run_main` itself in
`src/cobalt_main.cpp`, with a `webcpp::asio::io_context` and its run family; under Asyncify it
ends the program with `std::exit` so that the `co_return` value is the exit status. It reads
`main_promise`'s members, which are Boost's implementation, so compiling it against the pinned
Boost is the probe; if it cannot be kept, Cobalt's own `co_main` is the fallback, without the
limit.

### D12. Promises and events are bridge registrations

`async_await(executor, promise, token)` and `async_wait_event(executor, target, type, token)`
go through `async_initiate`, so every completion token works. Each is a registration: the
settlement or the event posts the handler; a rejection completes with
`webcpp::asio::browser::error::promise_rejected` (category `webcpp.asio`, value 1, never
reused) and the reason as the value; a cancellation completes at once with `operation_aborted`
and drops the registration (for an event, the listener is removed); a pending operation is
outstanding work; destroying the io_context destroys the handler without calling it; the
operation and the registration allocate through the handler's associated allocator.

### D13. Sockets that fail as values behind a transport point

Boost's sockets compile on Emscripten but connect through SOCKFS, which opens a WebSocket, and
`getaddrinfo` invents addresses. So on Emscripten `ip::tcp` and `ip::udp` are webcpp's protocol
classes with Boost's members, and the sockets and the acceptor are class templates over a policy
`browser::transport<Protocol>` whose primary completes every operation with
`operation_not_supported`, synchronously and asynchronously (through a post), never blocking;
`open` and `close` succeed. A relay library specialises the transport; the specialisation must
be visible in every translation unit before first use (one definition rule), so it is enabled
for a whole program through a b2 feature that `config.hpp` reads, designed with that library.

### D14. The resolver resolves nothing (option A)

`resolve(host, service)` completes with one entry carrying the host and service names and an
unspecified address with the service's port (`""` is 0; digits to 65535; `http` and `ws` 80,
`https` and `wss` 443; anything else `service_not_found`; `numeric_service` refuses names).
Reverse resolution fails with `operation_not_supported`; a plain socket's `connect` on the entry
fails the same way, so only webcpp::beast's browser streams accept it and Beast's layered client
code runs unchanged. A resolver that failed like the sockets was rejected: every Beast client
would change a line.

### D15. TLS names natively, a record on Emscripten, OpenSSL named by the program

`<webcpp/asio/ssl.hpp>` (not in the convenience header) is Boost's `ssl` natively, which needs
OpenSSL 3, and on Emscripten a record of the program's TLS settings that only webcpp::beast's
browser streams read. A program names `/webcpp/asio//openssl` for its native builds alone, by a
condition in its project; naming it for WebAssembly stops the compile with an instruction
(the owner rejected ignoring it there), and a machine that lacks OpenSSL stops the build.

### D16. No WASI target

Boost.Asio 1.92 does not compile for wasm32-wasip2 or wasm32-wasip3 with wasi-sdk 34. A library
on webcpp::asio declares native and Emscripten at most.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **Reading Emscripten and Boost internals.** The reactor behavior, Asyncify's data layout (the
  stack measurement), `ABORT`, `Emval` and `main_promise`'s members are implementation details
  of Emscripten 6.0.11 and Boost 1.92; the tests are the probes that fail when they change.
- **Asyncify's cost** is size (about 2.9 times) and a stack that must be measured; JSPI needs a
  browser that has it. Both are built and tested.
- **Boost's own `run` through a `boost::asio::io_context&`** has no limit and no detection.
- **A JavaScript error out of a handler** can break the context for good in three builds (D8).
- **The turn limit is a default, not a guarantee of frame rate**: up to `k + 1 +
  max_handlers_per_turn` handlers can run between two yields.
- **Cobalt's `run_main` depends on Boost's private layout** (D11) and the build keeps Cobalt's
  sources.

## Migration Plan

Nothing depends on asio yet. The library is developed in a superproject worktree at
`libs/asio`; once it is complete (task 23) the owner creates `webcpporg/asio` (gate G1), adds the
submodule (G2) and approves the pushes (G3). trystero's migration onto asio, webcpp::beast and
webcpp::webrtc are separate proposals.

## Open Questions

- The default `max_handlers_per_turn` of 1000 is to be measured in headless Chrome (task 13);
  the stop rule hands any value above an 8 ms 95th percentile to the owner.
- The b2 feature that enables a relay transport for a whole program (D13) is designed with the
  first relay library.
- `asyncify-stack-size` should be measured again when b2's release link passes the optimization
  level, and again when the Cobalt tests join the lane (task 16 step 5).
- The CI's levels (nightly, release) do not exist, so the Asyncify lanes run on every push
  (departure 1) until they do.
- `/webcpp/asio//openssl` links the system's shared OpenSSL until webcpp::crypto builds
  `/third_party//openssl` (departure 4).
- Native suites without exceptions run only on Emscripten for now (departure 5).
- The re-review of task 9's fix round was stopped by the owner's request to review every task one
  by one (2026-10-11); it is open.
