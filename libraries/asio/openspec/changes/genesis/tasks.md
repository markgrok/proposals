# Tasks

Each group is a task of `reference/plan.md` (24 tasks, 0 to 23), and each item one of its steps
in the plan's order, which holds the files, interfaces, code and expected output. A checked item
is done in `reference/source/` (the library, 13 commits, tip `7cfd449`) or, for the tasks marked
"superproject", in the 10 superproject commits of the asio branch (tip `df52767`; the commit
subjects are in `reference/STATUS.md`). The library's commits are named by their short hashes.
All of them are of 2026-10-11, as `R`.

## 0. The ledger and the baseline (plan: Task 0)

- [x] 0.1 Create the ledger with its first line (plan: Task 0, Step 1); kept outside the repositories
- [x] 0.2 Record the baseline: superproject commit, submodules, declared targets and lanes, em++ 6.0.11, node v26.7.0, Cobalt's sources, the lint (plan: Task 0, Step 2). The lint failed on one rule, the banned word in the committer field of 13 older superproject commits, left as found and escalated to the owner

## 1. The library's skeleton (plan: Task 1; library 307d5e6)

- [x] 1.1 Create the repository `libs/asio` and the worktree (plan: Task 1, Step 1)
- [x] 1.2 See the build not find the library (Step 2)
- [x] 1.3 Write the failing `test/config_test.cpp` (Step 3)
- [x] 1.4 Write `build.jam` (Step 4)
- [x] 1.5 Write `include/webcpp/asio/config.hpp` and `include/webcpp/asio.hpp` (Step 5)
- [x] 1.6 Write `test/Jamfile` (Step 6)
- [x] 1.7 Write the repository's files: README, AGENTS.md, LICENSE, `meta/libraries.json`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, the CI workflow (Step 7)
- [x] 1.8 Write the page: `doc/Jamfile`, `asio.adoc`, `overview.adoc`, `testing.adoc` (Step 8)
- [x] 1.9 Run the native and emscripten lanes (Step 9): native 4 of 4, emscripten 4 of 4 and the page green, as the ledger records
- [x] 1.10 Commit (Step 10): `307d5e6`, the root commit, 19 files

## 2. The suspension feature and the test support (superproject; plan: Task 2)

- [x] 2.1 Failing cases for the variants in `tools/test/emscripten_test.py` (plan: Task 2, Step 1)
- [x] 2.2 See them fail (Step 2)
- [x] 2.3 The propagated composite feature `webcpp-suspend` in `tools/webcpp.jam` (Step 3)
- [x] 2.4 The two cases pass (Step 4)
- [x] 2.5 The test support's fixture library `node_test_demo` (Step 5)
- [x] 2.6 Failing cases for the run's statuses (Step 6)
- [x] 2.7 `tools/node-test/node-pre.js` and `webcpp/test/exit_status.hpp` (Step 7)
- [x] 2.8 The cases pass (Step 8)
- [x] 2.9 Every existing library adopts the support in this task (Step 9): pratt's and trystero's emscripten lanes pass within the bound
- [x] 2.10 Document it in AGENTS.md, chapter 9 (Step 10)
- [x] 2.11 Commit (Step 11): `74a5592`, with `aac46de` (matrix_test reads a site of its own), `27743d9` (exit_status ends a test with its first status) and `5f46c28` (a test whose main never runs fails, and a factory flag among others is refused), the review's fixes

## 3. Names Boost's way, the variants' manifest and the size table (superproject; plan: Task 3)

- [x] 3.1 Failing `tools/variants/variants_test.py` (plan: Task 3, Step 1)
- [x] 3.2 See it fail (Step 2)
- [x] 3.3 `tools/variants/variants.py`: `manifest` and `table` (Step 3)
- [x] 3.4 Four cases pass (Step 4)
- [x] 3.5 Failing b2 cases for the names and the variants (Step 5)
- [x] 3.6 `webcpp.suspend-tag`, `webcpp.variants` and `webcpp.size-table` in `tools/webcpp.jam` (Step 6)
- [x] 3.7 The b2 cases, `emscripten_test.py`, `webcpp_jam_test.py` pass (Step 7)
- [x] 3.8 Document it in AGENTS.md (Step 8)
- [x] 3.9 The CI keeps the size tables as the artifact `sizes-<lane>` (Step 9)
- [x] 3.10 Commit (Step 10): `43ebf62`; two minors of its review were carried into task 4's dispatch and committed then: `0a229fc` (a variants manifest whose script is missing is refused) and `5d4e860` (a page program's variants asked for with JavaScript exceptions are refused: fixing the review minor showed a real defect, an asyncify request that linked the jspi artifact with JavaScript exceptions)

## 4. The io_context and the timers (plan: Task 4; library 9ba6bd6)

- [x] 4.1 Write the page's section `doc/names.adoc` (plan: Task 4, Step 1)
- [x] 4.2 Write the failing `test/names_test.cpp` (Step 2)
- [x] 4.3 See it fail (Step 3)
- [x] 4.4 Implement `io_context.hpp`, `steady_timer.hpp`, `system_timer.hpp`, `basic_waitable_timer.hpp` (Step 4)
- [x] 4.5 Run `names` natively and on emscripten (Step 5)
- [x] 4.6 Commit (Step 6): `9ba6bd6`

## 5. The variants' flags, the reactor and the exit status (plan: Task 5; library d1864ed, bd99586)

- [x] 5.1 Write the page's section `doc/building.adoc` (plan: Task 5, Step 1)
- [x] 5.2 Write the failing tests: `reactor_test.cpp`, `never_finishes_test.cpp`, `return_after_suspension_test.cpp` (Step 2)
- [x] 5.3 Implement the variants' flags in `build.jam` first (Step 3)
- [x] 5.4 Run `reactor` on the emscripten lane (Step 4)
- [x] 5.5 Implement the reactor made at construction (Step 5)
- [x] 5.6 Run the emscripten and asyncify lanes whole (Step 6)
- [x] 5.7 Commit (Step 7): `d1864ed`; the review's fix `bd99586` (the tests and the reactor cite the page and the measurement, not the plan) and, in the superproject, `bc851f3` (the lint reads a program of JavaScript-based exceptions in clang 23's spelling) and `dfa65d2` (exit_status returns its status on emscripten without `std::exit`, so no test prints Emscripten's keepRuntimeAlive notice)

## 6. The run family and the turn limit (plan: Task 6; library 58af480, e56ea03)

- [x] 6.1 Write the page's section `doc/run.adoc` (plan: Task 6, Step 1)
- [x] 6.2 Write the failing `run_family_test.cpp` and `turn_limit_test.cpp` (Step 2)
- [x] 6.3 See them fail (Step 3)
- [x] 6.4 Implement `detail/browser_imports.hpp`, `browser/src.hpp`, `src/browser_src.cpp` and the run family (Step 4)
- [x] 6.5 Run the native, emscripten and asyncify lanes (Step 5)
- [x] 6.6 Commit (Step 6): `58af480`; the review's fix `e56ea03` (a timed run checks its deadline before each handler, and the turn limit is tested by counting the yields instead of racing a 5 ms timer)

## 7. The bridge (plan: Task 7; library ceb7fab, ed53b11, 2f3d29b)

- [x] 7.1 Write the page's section `doc/browser.adoc` (plan: Task 7, Step 1)
- [x] 7.2 Write `test/browser_values.hpp` (Step 2)
- [x] 7.3 Write the failing `bridge_test.cpp` (Step 3)
- [x] 7.4 See it fail (Step 4)
- [x] 7.5 Implement `browser/bridge.hpp` and the bridge's JavaScript in `browser/src.hpp` (Step 5)
- [x] 7.6 Run the emscripten and asyncify lanes (Step 6)
- [x] 7.7 Commit (Step 7): `ceb7fab`; review round 1 `ed53b11` (`delivering()` reads the count the JavaScript functions keep, no public `unwound`, the event's handle is the boundary's, a trap and the runtime's control flow are left to Emscripten) and round 2 `2f3d29b` (comments and page say what the refusals hold, `delivering()` pinned to take no value); superproject `df52767` (the bare-throw lint rule leaves EM_JS and EM_ASM JavaScript alone)

## 8. Who may call the run family (plan: Task 8; library cb5c3ce, ec99f2d)

- [x] 8.1 Write the failing `detection_test.cpp` (plan: Task 8, Step 1)
- [x] 8.2 See `detection_jspi_exceptions_on` fail (Step 2)
- [x] 8.3 Implement the admission, the flag and `detail/flag_scope.hpp` (Step 3)
- [x] 8.4 Run the eight detection programs, four in each lane (Step 4)
- [x] 8.5 Commit (Step 5): `cb5c3ce`; the review's fix `ec99f2d` (the delivery case posts a handler first so that it fails with assertions off too; the page says what a JavaScript error out of a handler leaves and which calls go undetected)

## 9. Exceptions across a suspension, and Asyncify's stack (plan: Task 9; library 27aa662, 7cfd449)

- [x] 9.1 Write the failing `exceptions_test.cpp` (plan: Task 9, Step 1)
- [x] 9.2 Run `exceptions_asyncify` with a 64-byte stack and see it trap (Step 2)
- [x] 9.3 Measure the stack size (Step 3): 8192, twice 4096, measured as the bytes each unwind wrote
- [x] 9.4 Run every lane (Step 4)
- [x] 9.5 Commit (Step 5): `27aa662`; fix round 1 `7cfd449` (the stack measured in every link, `asyncify-stack-size`, the bridge enters nothing after an abort)
- [ ] 9.6 The scoped re-review of fix round 1, stopped on 2026-10-11 when the owner asked to review every task one by one (open; not part of the plan's steps)

- [ ] 10.1 Write the page's section `doc/timers.adoc` (plan: Task 10, Step 1)

- [ ] 11.2 Write the failing `test/allocation_test.cpp`: `operator new`, the C library and the aligned allocations counted, the runtime's own allocations kept out by name (Step 2)

- [ ] 11.4 Commit (Step 4)
