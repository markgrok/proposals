# wasi

wasi is a header-only helper for C++20 programs built as WebAssembly
components, one of the libraries of
[webcpp](https://github.com/webcpporg/webcpp). Its first part,
`webcpp::wasi::http`, is an HTTP handler. You write one function, the main,
that turns a request's method and target into a response; wasi exports the
handler `wasmtime serve` (or any host of `wasi:http`) calls, reads the
request, calls your main and writes the answer back. It covers WASI 0.2
(wasip2) and WASI 0.3 (wasip3).

| Header | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `<webcpp/wasi.hpp>` | the whole library: it includes the entry point |
| `<webcpp/wasi/http/entrypoint.hpp>` | the handler and the main's macros; it compiles only for wasip2 and wasip3 |
| `<webcpp/wasi/http/response.hpp>` | only the response, for code that needs no ABI; it also compiles natively |
| `<webcpp/wasi/config.hpp>` | `WEBCPP_WASI_NO_EXCEPTIONS`, defined without exceptions, by `WEBCPP_NO_EXCEPTIONS` or by your build; every header includes it first, and it compiles natively too |

Requirements: C++20, wasi-sdk 34, wit-bindgen's C generator (0.62.0
measured), the `wasi:http` WIT of your target, and a host such as wasmtime
(47.0.3 measured). The headers include only the standard library and the
bindings wit-bindgen writes. The helper needs neither exceptions nor RTTI
and imposes neither: webcpp builds it with exceptions on wasip2 and wasip3,
where an exception that escapes your main traps the instance (see
[Your main](#your-main)).

## A complete example

A component that greets whoever calls it, built by hand with wasi-sdk. These
are the exact files and commands, which webcpp's test `by_hand` runs in the
lane `http` of `example/`, on wasip2 and on wasip3, with wasi-sdk 34,
wit-bindgen 0.62.0 and wasmtime 47.0.3
([example/by_hand/build.sh](example/by_hand/build.sh)).

`wit/world.wit`, the world your component exports (name it as you like):

<!-- include::example/by_hand/p2/wit/world.wit[tag=world] -->
```wit
package example:hello;

world service {
  export wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.12;
}
```

with `wit/deps/` linked to the `wasi:http` 0.2.12 WIT: the `wit/deps`
directory of the Rust crate `wasip2` 1.0.4.

`main.cpp`, which is [example/http_hello.cpp](example/http_hello.cpp):

<!-- include::example/http_hello.cpp[tag=main] -->
```cpp
#include <webcpp/wasi/http/entrypoint.hpp>

WEBCPP_WASI_HTTP_MAIN_BEGIN(method, target)
    if (method != "GET") {
        return {.status = 405, .content_type = "text/plain", .body = "only GET\n"};
    }
    return {
        .status = 200,
        .content_type = "text/plain",
        .body = "hello from " + std::string(target) + "\n",
    };
WEBCPP_WASI_HTTP_MAIN_END()
```

Generate the bindings, renaming the world to `webcpp_wasi_http`, then compile
and link a reactor with wasi-sdk's `clang` and `clang++`, where `WIT_BINDGEN`
is the wit-bindgen program, `WASI_SDK` wasi-sdk's directory and `WASI` this
repository's:

<!-- include::example/by_hand/build.sh[tag=p2] -->
```sh
"$WIT_BINDGEN" c --world service --rename-world webcpp_wasi_http \
    --out-dir gen wit

"$WASI_SDK/bin/clang" --target=wasm32-wasip2 \
    -c gen/webcpp_wasi_http.c -o gen/webcpp_wasi_http.o -Igen
"$WASI_SDK/bin/clang++" --target=wasm32-wasip2 -std=c++20 \
    -fwasm-exceptions -mllvm -wasm-use-legacy-eh=false \
    -mexec-model=reactor -DWEBCPP_WASI_HTTP_P2 -I"$WASI/include" -Igen \
    main.cpp gen/webcpp_wasi_http.o gen/webcpp_wasi_http_component_type.o \
    -fwasm-exceptions -lunwind -o hello.wasm
```

Serve it:

```sh
wasmtime serve -S cli --addr 127.0.0.1:8080 hello.wasm
```

and call it. `curl -i` also prints the two headers wasmtime adds to every
response, `date` and `transfer-encoding`, which are left out here; the rest
is [example/http_hello.expected](example/http_hello.expected), the
transcript that webcpp's test of the example compares:

<!-- include::example/http_hello.expected[] -->
```
$ curl -i -X GET 'http://localhost:8080/v1/greeting?name=ana'
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: text/plain

hello from /v1/greeting?name=ana

$ curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/x
HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
content-type: text/plain

only GET
```

## Building with b2

In a b2 project that uses webcpp, a program that exports the HTTP handler and
nothing else links `/webcpp/wasi//http`, and is done. That target adds wasi's
headers; generates with wit-bindgen the bindings of the standard world of the
program's target, `wit/http-p2.wit` or `wit/http-p3.wit`, renamed
`webcpp_wasi_http`, and links them; and defines `WEBCPP_WASI_HTTP_P2` on the
toolset `clang-wasip2`, or `WEBCPP_WASI_HTTP_P3` on `clang-wasip3`. A
component is then an `exe` with that library and
`<linkflags>-mexec-model=reactor`, which `webcpp.serve` adds itself (the
superproject's `tools/component/component.jam`), as `example/Jamfile` shows,
building and serving the example:

```
webcpp.targets wasip2 wasip3 ;
webcpp.serve http_hello.cpp : <library>/webcpp/wasi//http ;
```

A program whose world exports more than the HTTP handler uses
`/webcpp/wasi//wasi`, the headers alone, generates its own world's bindings
with `webcpp.wit-bindings`, renamed `webcpp_wasi_http`, and defines the macro
of its target itself.

b2 looks for wit-bindgen at `-sWIT_BINDGEN=<path>`, else at
`.local/wit-bindgen/wit-bindgen` in the superproject, else on `PATH`; for the
`wasi:http` WIT of each version at `-sWASI_WIT_P2=<dir>` and
`-sWASI_WIT_P3=<dir>`, else at `.local/wasi-wit/p2` and `.local/wasi-wit/p3`;
and, to serve a component, for wasmtime at `-sWASMTIME=<path>`, else on
`PATH`. A build that needs one that is not there stops, naming it and every
place it looked. A native build needs none of them.

## Your main

Your main's body is written between the two macros, as `main.cpp` above
does. `WEBCPP_WASI_HTTP_MAIN_BEGIN(method, target)` and
`WEBCPP_WASI_HTTP_MAIN_END()` define the function
`webcpp::wasi::http::http_main`, which takes the two `std::string_view`
parameters named in the first macro and returns a
`webcpp::wasi::http::response`, and, before it, the `extern "C"` handler your
world exports. Write the pair once in the program, in one `.cpp`.

| Parameter | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `method` | the method, as `"GET"`, `"POST"`, ...; an extension method as it was sent |
| `target` | the request target, path and query, as `"/v1/greeting?name=ana"`; `"/"` when the request carried none |

Both are views into the request, which the handler frees once it has written
the response: the response's content type may view them, and you copy what
you keep beyond the request. To split the target, parse it with a URL
library, Boost.URL's `parse_origin_form` for example.

The handler catches nothing. On wasip2 and wasip3, where webcpp builds a
program with exceptions, an exception that escapes your main traps the
instance: wasmtime 47 prints the trap on its standard error, `thrown Wasm
exception`, and answers the client with its own `500 Internal Server Error`,
an HTML page, then serves the requests after it.

The main's body is inside a function of `namespace webcpp::wasi::http`: name
your own code with its full namespace, or with a namespace alias declared at
the top of the body.

clang-format reads the body as a function's when its configuration names the
two macros, as this repository's `.clang-format` does:

```
MacroBlockBegin: "^WEBCPP_WASI_HTTP_MAIN_BEGIN$"
MacroBlockEnd: "^WEBCPP_WASI_HTTP_MAIN_END$"
```

## The response

`webcpp::wasi::http::response`, in `<webcpp/wasi/http/response.hpp>`, is a
struct of three members:

| Member | Type | What it holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | `unsigned`, 200 by default | the status, sent as it is within 100 to 599; outside them the handler answers an internal error instead, which wasmtime 47 sends as its own `500 Internal Server Error` |
| `content_type` | `std::string_view`, empty by default | the `content-type` header, sent only when not empty; read after your main returns, so it views a literal, like `"application/json"`, or the method or the target, never a string of your main's own; one the host refuses, with a CR, an LF or a NUL for example, answers an internal error instead |
| `body` | `std::string`, empty by default | the body, sent whole, however long |

No other header is sent.

`response.hpp` includes nothing of the component ABI, so the rest of your
program can build responses, hold them, pass them around (as messages between
actors, for example) and be tested natively.

## What your build provides

What `/webcpp/wasi//http` provides in b2, and what a build by hand provides
itself:

| What | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `-DWEBCPP_WASI_HTTP_P2` or `-DWEBCPP_WASI_HTTP_P3`, exactly one | chooses the target; the header refuses to compile with neither or both |
| the bindings generated with `--rename-world webcpp_wasi_http` | the header includes `webcpp_wasi_http.h` and uses the names wit-bindgen gives the world, `webcpp_wasi_http_string_t` and the like; renaming makes them the same in every project, whatever its world is called |
| `webcpp_wasi_http.c` compiled as C for the target, and `webcpp_wasi_http_component_type.o`, linked | the glue that calls your handler, and the world's type information for the component linker |
| the directory of the bindings on the include path | for `webcpp_wasi_http.h` |
| `-mexec-model=reactor` on the link | the program is a reactor: it exports a handler and has no C `main`; wasmtime 47 also serves it linked as a command, but webcpp builds and tests reactors |

The host has its part too: `wasmtime serve` runs a component of wasi with
`-S cli`, since wasi-libc imports parts of `wasi:cli`, and on wasip3 with
`-S cli,p3 -W component-model-async`.

## wasip3

The same main works on WASI 0.3; only the build differs, as webcpp builds it
and serves it on wasip3:

- the world exports `wasi:http/handler@0.3.0`, with the WIT of `wasi:http`
  0.3.0 in `wit/deps/`: the `wit/deps` directory of the Rust crate `wasip3`
  0.9.0;
- the bindings are generated with
  `--async 'wasi:http/handler@0.3.0#handle'` beside `--rename-world`;
- everything is compiled for `--target=wasm32-wasip3`, the bindings' `.c`
  with `-pthread`, and the program with `-DWEBCPP_WASI_HTTP_P3`;
- wasmtime serves it with `-S cli,p3 -W component-model-async`.

webcpp compiles a program for wasip2 or wasip3 with exceptions on,
`-fwasm-exceptions -mllvm -wasm-use-legacy-eh=false`, and links it with
`-fwasm-exceptions -lunwind`, and the commands of both versions here do the
same; wasmtime serves it with the flags above and no other. Built with
`-fno-exceptions` in their place, the component answers the same: webcpp
measured that once, by hand, on wasip3.

The handler is lifted asynchronously, waits for every write inside the task,
and always ends with `EXIT`.

## How a request flows

```
host (wasmtime serve)
  └─ calls the exported handler            exports_wasi_http_incoming_handler_handle
       ├─ reads the method and the target
       ├─ calls your main                  http_main(method, target) -> response
       ├─ answers an internal error instead, for a status outside 100-599
       │  or a content type the host refuses
       ├─ sends the status and the content-type
       ├─ writes the body, every byte      wasip2: chunks of 4096; wasip3: until the stream took all
       └─ frees the request
```

A failure the host reports before the response is sent answers an internal
error; after it is sent, a body not written whole is reported the way each
WASI version defines.

## Limits

The handler hands your main only the method and the target. It reads no
request header and no request body, and sends no response header but
`content-type`. A main that needs a request body, or to set other headers,
waits for the helper to grow.

## Building and testing

wasi is developed inside the webcpp superproject, as a Boost library is
developed inside Boost:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/webcpporg/webcpp
    cd webcpp
    b2 toolset=clang-wasip2 testing.launcher=wasmtime libs/wasi/test libs/wasi/example

builds and runs the tests and the examples that are not served, for
wasm32-wasip2, with the toolset that `user-config.jam` registers against
wasi-sdk. The components wasmtime serves, the example's among them, run in a
lane of their own, `http`, in the tests and in the examples:

    b2 toolset=clang-wasip2 testing.launcher=wasmtime \
        libs/wasi/test//http libs/wasi/example//http

builds each, has wasmtime serve it and compares its answers with its
`.expected` file. `toolset=clang-wasip3` does the same for wasm32-wasip3.
Natively, only what compiles without the component ABI is built.
