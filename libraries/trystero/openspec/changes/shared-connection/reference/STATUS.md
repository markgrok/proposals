# webcpp::trystero, shared connection: where the implementation stands, and how to resume

Written 2026-10-13, when this proposal took the work in. `spec.md` is the specification of
2026-10-11 (approved by the owner that day); `plan.md` is the plan (22 tasks, its frontmatter still
says `draft`, its checkboxes are all unchecked: the ledger, not the plan, recorded progress);
`../tasks.md` is the checklist; `patches/` holds the branch's 25 commits as patches, `0001` to
`0025` in order, applying on `a7d04b8` (an ancestor of the published `160f431`); and
`uncommitted.diff` is `git diff HEAD` of the branch's working tree on 2026-10-13, task 6's
stopped work on `room.hpp` and `shared_test.cpp`. A change carries only its diff from the commit
it was requested against, never the library's whole tree: the tree at the branch's tip is
`a7d04b8` with the patches applied.


`plan.md` was written before the history of webcpp was rewritten on 2026-10-12 and 2026-10-13
(the commit identity became R), so the hashes it cites are the earlier ones: its `8e8911f` is
`a7d04b8` today, the same commit, an ancestor of the published `160f431`.

## Where it stands

The work is a **local branch, unpublished**: the library's repository in the worktree
`webcpp-trystero-shared` of the superproject (branch `trystero-shared`), branch `shared-connection`
of `libs/trystero`, tip `84d4eeb` of 2026-10-11, 25 commits as `R` on `a7d04b8`. Nothing was
pushed; no CI ran. `a7d04b8` precedes the genesis commit `160f431` (the changelog, `config.hpp`
including `<webcpp/config.hpp>` and `WEBCPP_NO_EXCEPTIONS`, the maintainer's public address, and
the interop flood fixes `d2563a6` and `571a2e4` came after it), so the branch must be rebased
onto `160f431` before its gates. The controller's ledger records that on 2026-10-11 at 18:50 the
owner stopped every task to review them one by one, with task 6 stopped mid-work.

| Increment | Task | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0 baseline | done |
| 1 | 1 the memory backend's hooks | done, patches `0001`, `0002` |
| 1 | 2 `detail::connection` and `detail::binding` | done, patches `0003` to `0006` |
| 1 | 3 `app_config`, `room_options`, `detail::app_impl` | done, patches `0007` to `0010` |
| 1 | 4 the room on the connection layer, `peer_link` removed | done, patches `0011` to `0017` |
| 2 | 5a shared test helpers and the virtual clock in them | done, patches `0018` to `0020` |
| 2 | 5b `already_joined`, `too_many_rooms` | done, patch `0021` |
| 2 | 5c `app`, `app::join`, `room_config` and the standalone room removed | done, patches `0022` to `0025` |
| 2 | 6 binding by presence and kept frames | started: the working tree of the branch held uncommitted edits to `room.hpp` and `shared_test.cpp` when this proposal was written; they are `uncommitted.diff` |
| 2 | 7 to 12 | not started |
| 3 | 13 `room_options::memory`, payload copied once | not started |
| 4 | 14a to 14c interop scenarios | not started |
| 5 | 15 pages, 16 gates | not started |

What exists at the branch's tip: `include/webcpp/trystero/app.hpp` (`class app`, `max_rooms` 64, `join`,
`on_error`, move and destruction that release the state), `options.hpp` (`app_config`,
`room_options` without `memory`, `default_ice_servers`), `detail/app_impl.hpp`,
`detail/connection.hpp` (connection and binding), `error.hpp` with the two new errors, `room.hpp`
without `room_config` and with the connection layer, the extended memory backend and
`test/support/rooms.hpp`, and the tests `memory_backend`, `connection`, `app_impl` and `shared`
(10 cases: the app's id in every room, the setup reports, refusal of a second join and of the 65th
room, two apps of one id never meeting, two and three rooms on one connection, a second connection
dropped, and the moved-from, destroyed and assigned app). What the branch does not have yet:
binding by presence and by kept frames in the rooms, signaling reuse, the binding conditions, the
rebinding schedule, the acceptance of the last 8 challenges, `room_options::memory`, the interop
scenarios and the pages. The `shared_hardened` and `shared_no_exceptions` targets exist.

### What was measured

Nothing was run for this proposal. What the controller's ledger records (not re-run here): at
task 5c's fix round, on 2026-10-11, native 49 tests, Emscripten 57, the gcc-15 gate 9 of 9, the
oracle byte-identical, interop native 19 of 19 and Emscripten 16 of 16, the sanitizer run
(address and undefined, `norecover`) of `shared` and `connection`, lint clean, doc-check clean,
15 of 15 runnable mutants killed. Each earlier task has a recorded review and fix rounds in the
same ledger (mutants killed per task: 28 of 28 runnable for task 1, 30 of 41 for task 2 with every
survivor but one argued undetectable, 15 of 15 for task 5c).

## Open items

1. Tasks 6 to 16 of the plan (`../tasks.md`).
2. The rebase onto `160f431`, dropping `6b1e4ba` (cherry-picked as patch `0022`) for the owner's
   ruling that `4aef1c0` supersedes it.
3. The gates G1 (push `shared-connection` to `webcpporg/trystero` and merge) and G2 (bump the
   submodule in the superproject, together with the superproject's `jamroot_test` check that the
   explicit library search needs), both the controller's, with the owner's agreement.
4. An upstream report of the password exposure of the shared connection (listed among the pending
   reports); the spec's ruling 4.
5. The documentation: every page and file section 7 of the spec lists, and the migration page.

## How to resume

1. Work in the worktree `webcpp-trystero-shared` of the superproject on branch `trystero-shared`
   (or make a new one; `libs/trystero` on `shared-connection`), with `.local/` linked to the main
   checkout's, as the plan's Global Constraints say. Run every b2 command from the worktree with
   the user config and `-u CPATH -u CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH -u C_INCLUDE_PATH`.
2. Read `spec.md` sections 4, 6 and 9 and the plan's "Conflicts with the spec" table (18 rulings
   where the plan departs from the text) before any task: the plan, not the spec, fixes the
   task-level choices.
3. Take the next task, task 6: its brief is in the controller's ledger directory; the red test is
   `shared_test.cpp` cases 5 and 12 with two rooms. Check the uncommitted edits of the branch
   before starting; they are the first draft of that task.
4. Each task: a failing test first, the implementation, the lanes (native, Emscripten, gcc-15
   core tests, the sanitizer run), the lint, a review; commits as `R` without a trailer, staged by
   path.
5. After increment 5: every lane from scratch, a whole-branch review against the spec, then the
   gates.
