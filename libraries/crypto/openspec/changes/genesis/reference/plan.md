# webcpp::crypto, increments 1 to 5: Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** a new library, webcpp::crypto, at `libs/crypto`: authenticated encryption (AES-GCM,
ChaCha20-Poly1305), the AES block cipher, a `random_device` on the system's or the browser's
generator, a constant-time `equal`, and secp256k1 (BIP340, ECDSA, ECDH), each running on a
backend that is a C or C++ library itself (BearSSL, OpenSSL, ctaes, libsecp256k1, Botan),
built from its own sources by `third_party/Jamfile` or found on the machine, on native,
wasip2, wasip3 and Emscripten; then trystero moved onto it.

**Architecture:**
- **The library is header-only** (`/webcpp/crypto//crypto`, an alias). Its algorithm types
  (`aes128/192/256<Backend>`, `gcm<Cipher>`, `chacha20_poly1305<Backend>`,
  `secp256k1::basic_keypair<Backend>`) do every guard, the moved-from state, the incremental
  seal's state machine, the length accounting and the zeroing of a failed `open` themselves,
  once, for every backend; a backend's header supplies only the work, as specialisations of
  six traits in `webcpp::crypto::detail` (`block_state`, `block_engine`, `gcm_state`,
  `gcm_engine`, `chacha_state`, `chacha_engine`). A state trait is what an object stores and
  never refuses, so `aes256<backends::bearssl>` is a complete type that `gcm` can name; an
  engine trait is used only inside member functions, so a backend without the algorithm
  refuses with its `static_assert` only where the algorithm is called.
- **The C libraries** are submodules under `third_party/libs/`, built file by file by
  `third_party/Jamfile` into static libraries whose usage requirements give
  `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_HAS_<NAME>=1`; webcpp's `libs/crypto/src/canary_<name>.c` joins each. OpenSSL
  and Botan are found by `webcpp.external` and linked shared or static by a propagated
  feature; a program that names one the machine lacks stops with an instruction.
- **The superproject** gains: the project id `/third_party` beside `/webcpp/third_party`;
  the incidental feature `webcpp-own` that tells webcpp's own tests from a user's program;
  `webcpp.external-root` and `webcpp.external-looked`; `webcpp.same-program`, two `exe`s of
  one program with and without a library under one output name, compared byte for byte, in
  b2 itself (spec 8.7); a Python test of the tools, `tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py`, which
  builds the user's Jamfiles of the documentation and every build stop as fixtures, the
  pattern of `tools/test/fixtures/` and `tools/test/emscripten_test.py` (no new kind of
  library directory, no b2 inside b2; owner item O4); a lint rule on the entropy header and
  one on the canary's pins; the CI's per-library list of external libraries, own lanes
  included; OpenSSL's libssl and libcrypto as one target, shared or static, which asio's and
  trystero's OpenSSL move onto; NIST's archives pinned by URL and SHA-256; Botan's action; the
  nightly level of the own lanes (owner gate O2).
- **The lanes:** the ordinary ones (every native compiler, wasip2, wasip3, emscripten) run
  the tests of `libs/crypto/test` and the examples on every push; own lanes, each naming its
  targets, run what is heavy or needs a tool: `c-suites` (the C libraries' own test programs),
  `constant-time` (Valgrind, MemorySanitizer, dudect; Linux), `browser` (Chrome: WebCrypto as
  an oracle, the audio worklet, throughput), `sizes`, `throughput`; with O2's recommendation,
  the heavy ones (`c-suites`, `constant-time`, `browser`, `throughput`) at the CI's nightly
  level, which this track builds for own lanes. The library's own workflow `runners.yml`,
  nightly, runs what needs a runner the matrix lacks: Linux arm64 and macOS throughput, and
  the deterministic constant-time checks on arm64. The user's Jamfiles run in the tools job
  of the superproject's CI (`tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py`).

**Tech Stack:**
- C++20, b2 5.5.3, Boost 1.92 (System, Hash2, Core's lightweight_test, JSON in tests),
  wasi-sdk 34 with wasmtime 47.0.3, Emscripten 6.0.11 with node 26.7.0,
  chrome-headless-shell 155.0.8059.39, Python 3.9+ for the tools.
- BearSSL at `7bea48e5e850ab4cafbe68d3765cdaba13a86d6f` (the mirror `webcpporg/bearssl`),
  libsecp256k1 v0.8.0 at `6e2c8bc4ecdc6e71dbe7a368f360d8d453ce435d`, ctaes as Bitcoin Core
  v31.1 ships it (`9be056a8a72b624dae9623b2f7bded92c2a21c91`), OpenSSL 3 (3.0.13 on the CI's
  Linux, 3.6.4 on macOS, 3.6.5 on Windows), Botan 3.13.0.
- Test data: Wycheproof at `12fd3aaf33eb5fa1f52e026912ee00c054f9d984`, BIP340's
  `test-vectors.csv` from `bitcoin/bips` at `927b6de9915c9262615a6399de51b200f81e5aa4`, NIST
  CAVP's `gcmtestvectors.zip` and `KAT_AES.zip` pinned by URL and SHA-256 and fetched once
  into `.local/nist-cavp` (owner gate O3).

**Spec:** `~/.buzz/PLANS/WEBCPP_CRYPTO_SPEC.md` (approved by the owner on
2026-10-11; "the spec" below, cited by section). The owner's decisions:
`~/.buzz/PLANS/WEBCPP_DESIGN.md`, cited by date and title. Its sources, cited by the spec's
short names: C-LIBS (`~/.buzz/RESEARCH/C_LIBRARIES_IN_WEBCPP.md`), PROBES
(`~/dev/webcpp/.superpowers/sdd/plan-reviews/c-backends/`), CR-PROBES
(`.../plan-reviews/crypto-review/`), PROBE-R3 (`~/.claude/jobs/fcf3a902/tmp/crypto-r3/probe/`,
not durable), crypto-r3-review (`.../plan-reviews/crypto-r3-review/`).

This plan's own measurements, taken on 2026-10-11 for it (macOS arm64, b2 5.5.3, Apple clang
21, Homebrew OpenSSL 3.6.4); scratch under `~/.claude/jobs/fcf3a902/tmp/crypto-plan/`
(not durable; each result is copied here):
- **M1, two project ids.** A Jamroot with `use-project /webcpp/third_party : third_party ;`
  and `use-project /third_party : third_party ;`, the Jamfile declaring
  `project /webcpp/third_party ;`: `/third_party//bearssl` and `/webcpp/third_party//bearssl`
  both resolve, and `/third_party//nothere` fails with "Unable to find file or target named
  '/third_party//nothere'" (`pid/`).
- **M2, a skipped program does not evaluate a library's stop.** A `webcpp.run` declared
  `native` that names an alias whose `<conditional>` stops the build on emscripten, built
  with `toolset=emscripten`: the program is skipped and the stop never fires; a program of
  every target beside it builds (`p2/`).
- **M3, NIST CAVP's archives.** `gcmtestvectors.zip`, 9,154,174 bytes, SHA-256
  `f9fc479e134cde2980b3bb7cddbcb567b2cd96fd753835243ed067699f26a023`, from
  `https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/mac/gcmtestvectors.zip`:
  six files, each 7,875 cases, 1,125 of them with 128-bit tags (IVs of 8, 96 and 1,024
  bits); with 128-bit tags, `gcmEncryptExtIV{128,192,256}.rsp` 1,125 each, and
  `gcmDecrypt128.rsp` 535 valid and 590 `FAIL`, `gcmDecrypt192.rsp` 557 and 568,
  `gcmDecrypt256.rsp` 559 and 566. `KAT_AES.zip`, 726,299 bytes, SHA-256
  `a203b16c9246b2ebae31dee5de21a606be80cf78ceabaca37150236fa098eb60`, from
  `.../documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip`: the ECB files `ECBGFSbox{128,192,256}.rsp` (14, 12, 10
  cases), `ECBKeySbox` (42, 48, 32), `ECBVarKey` (256, 384, 512), `ECBVarTxt` (256, 256, 256).
- **M4, RFC 8439's two vectors through OpenSSL 3.6.4** (`a5/a5.c`): section 2.8.2's 114-byte
  plaintext gives the ciphertext
  `d31a8d34648e60db7b86afbc53ef7ec2a4aded51296e08fea9e2b5a736ee62d63dbea45e8ca9671282fafb69da92728b1a71de0a9e060b2905d6a5b67ecd3b3692ddbd7f2d778b8c9803aee328091b58fab324e4fad675945585808b4831d7bc3ff4def08e4b7a9de576d26586cec64b6116`
  and the tag `1ae10b594f09e26a7e902ecbd0600691`; appendix A.5's 265-byte plaintext (key
  `1c9240a5eb55d38af333888604f6b5f0473917c1402b80099dca5cbc207075c0`, nonce
  `000000000102030405060708`, AAD `f33388860000000000004e91`) gives the tag
  `eead9d67890cbb22392336fea1851f38` and the ciphertext written in Task 35.
- **M5, an interposer linked at launch is enough on macOS.** PROBE-R3's `probe on`, run with
  and without `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`, its `libinterpose.dylib` linked into the program:
  identical counts (first `make`: adapter 6,061 allocations, 192 reallocations; C library from
  libcrypto 0, all callers 2).
- **M6, upstream facts read for this plan:** `gh api` gives Wycheproof's `12fd3aaf` as
  `12fd3aaf33eb5fa1f52e026912ee00c054f9d984` (2026-10-06), `bitcoin/bips` master as
  `927b6de9915c9262615a6399de51b200f81e5aa4` (2026-10-02), the last change of
  `bip-0340/test-vectors.csv` as `200f9b26` (2023-04-20); `webcpporg/bearssl` exists, master
  `7bea48e5e850ab4cafbe68d3765cdaba13a86d6f`, tags v0.4 to v0.6, and `webcpporg/crypto` does
  not. Botan 3.13.0's release archive `https://botan.randombit.net/releases/Botan-3.13.0.tar.xz`
  is 9,598,736 bytes, SHA-256
  `12f5a8358890bbee82edfe9d2e7769b0a610b6dd0e0698aea13d20a675d84620`, and Homebrew's `botan`
  is 3.13.0; in it `GCM_Mode::update_granularity()` and
  `ChaCha20Poly1305_Mode::update_granularity()` return 1 (`src/lib/modes/aead/gcm/gcm.cpp:63-65`,
  `chacha20poly1305/chacha20poly1305.cpp:30-32`).
- **M7, the tree.** `~/dev/webcpp` `main` (73aa1ea) has no `third_party/`; `infra/shared`
  (13e6e22, worktree `~/dev/webcpp-infra`) has `third_party/Jamfile` (project
  `/webcpp/third_party`, targets `json-schema-test-suite` and `srell`), `webcpp.data` and
  `webcpp.generated`. `tools/ci/matrix.py` has no CI level, no Linux arm64 lane, and marks a
  library external with one boolean, which installs OpenSSL, libsecp256k1 and libdatachannel
  together. `.local/openssl/lib` holds `libcrypto.dylib` and `libssl.dylib` alone, links the
  OpenSSL action makes; Homebrew's `/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/lib` holds `libcrypto.a`. The
  lint's world rule matches `random_device`, `getentropy`, `RAND_bytes`, `<sys/random.h>` and
  `<unistd.h>` on any line of a library header without `lint-world:`.

**Not in this plan:**
- **The CI's levels, whole** (DESIGN, 2026-10-10 "CI in three levels"): the fast set, the
  native lanes without exceptions and the release level are the levels' own change. This plan
  builds only the nightly level of the own lanes (Task 25b, owner gate O2); the ordinary lanes
  keep running on every push.
- **The `asyncify` suspension variant for crypto's emscripten tests** (spec 8: "Emscripten in
  both suspension variants"): crypto's tests are synchronous and never suspend, so the variant
  changes nothing they do; it is a release-level lane of the levels' change, recorded in
  AGENTS.md chapter 13 by Task 25 (m16).
- **A Botan WebAssembly build** (spec section 3.6, "a later increment's, if a user needs it").
- **An incremental `open`** (spec section 2.4: "a later increment may add it").
- **webcpp::webrtc** and **webcpp::beast**, which may use this library later.

## The base, the order of the tracks, and the rebase points

The controller's rulings of the first two review rounds (C1, O1, I17; N2, N3, n3, n4):

0. **The base is webcpp's `main` after the owner's force push.** The 13 commits
   `dd4b1b3..f7c96d3` of today's `main` carry a committer identity that must not be published
   (the controller's ledger, "2026-10-11 INCIDENT"); `fix/ci-site` re-commits them (its tip
   `536d899`), and the owner force-pushes `main` to it. After that, `f7c96d3` is not an
   ancestor of `main`, and no branch of this track, nor any rebase in this plan, ever has one
   of the 13 commits as its base or in its history. Nothing of this plan starts before the
   force push: Task 0a's Step 1 checks it.
1. **`infra/shared` is integrated first** (Task 0a): rebased onto that `main`, following the
   shared infrastructure plan's own "Integration" steps, its lanes run, and integrated into
   `main` before anything of this track, and before config's Task 12 (the controller's ruling
   on n4: config waits on stage 4 anyway, and config rebases onto `main` after infra, taking
   the conflicts in `Jamroot`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `tools/lint/lint.sh`,
   `tools/lint/lint_test.py` and `tools/test/harness.py`). The crypto track is never based on
   the stale `infra/shared`.
2. **The asio track** (`~/dev/webcpp-asio`, branch `asio`) rebases onto the `main` of point 1
   (its controller's rebase, off `f7c96d3`) and goes through its Task 2. It writes the same
   superproject files as this track: `Jamroot`, `tools/webcpp.jam` (its Task 2:
   `webcpp-suspend`, `/webcpp//node-test` on `webcpp.run`, `run-fail` and `example`; its
   Task 3: `variants`, `size-table`), `tools/node-test/`, `tools/ci/matrix.py`,
   `.github/workflows/library.yml`, `tools/test/emscripten_test.py`,
   `tools/test/webcpp_jam_test.py` and AGENTS.md chapters 1, 9 and 13.
3. **This track's base and rebase points** (N2). `lib/crypto` is created at Task 0 from asio's
   Task 2 commit on the rebased `asio` (the commit asio's ledger,
   `~/dev/webcpp-asio/.superpowers/sdd/WEBCPP_ASIO_PLAN/progress.md`, records as Task 2's
   last), so `<webcpp/test/exit_status.hpp>` exists before this plan's Task 1 writes its first
   test; if asio has integrated into `main` by then, `lib/crypto` starts from that `main`. The
   rebase points:
   - onto `main` each time asio or another track that writes the same files integrates; the
     tracks that do: asio (the files of point 2), the site plan
     (`~/.buzz/PLANS/WEBCPP_SITE_PLAN_4_5.md`, worktree `~/dev/webcpp-site`, branch `site`; its
     Tasks 23 and 31 edit `tools/webcpp.jam`, `Jamroot` and AGENTS.md chapter 9, n3), and
     trystero's shared-connection track (point 5);
   - after Task 25 (end of increment 1), after Task 30, before Task 31, after Task 36.

   Every rebase in this plan is written
   `git -c user.name=R -c user.email=github.overboard312@passmail.net rebase <base>`, and at each
   point, before anything else runs, the identity check (N3):

```bash
test "$(git log --format='%an %ae %cn %ce' HEAD | grep -vc '^R github.overboard312@passmail.net R github.overboard312@passmail.net$')" = 0 \
  && ! git merge-base --is-ancestor f7c96d3 HEAD \
  && echo 'identity: ok' || echo 'identity: stop'
```

   The check passes when it prints `identity: ok`: every commit of the whole history, base
   included, is authored and committed by `R <github.overboard312@passmail.net>`, and `f7c96d3` is not
   in it. Its first two lines, without the `echo`s, are a command whose exit status is 0
   exactly then, which a script chains with `&&` (r1: `grep -vc` alone exits 1 when it prints
   `0`, so its count is compared by `test`; a clone that never had `f7c96d3` makes
   `merge-base` exit 128, which `!` also reads as absent). Measured on 2026-10-11 with this
   text: today's `main` gives `identity: stop`, `fix/ci-site` and `infra/shared` give
   `identity: ok`. Then the lint, whose banned-word rule reads every tracked file, and the
   track's lanes; the ledger records the base's commit and the check's output. A check that fails stops the track and is reported; nothing is pushed.
4. **Every test of crypto uses asio's test support**, on the base from Task 0 (point 3): every
   `main` of a test ends `return webcpp::test::exit_status(boost::report_errors());` with
   `#include <webcpp/test/exit_status.hpp>`, which `/webcpp//node-test` puts on every program;
   under node the pre-js bounds each test (120 s by default; a test that needs longer, the
   C suites and dudect, calls `webcpp::test::bound` with its own and says why) and turns a
   `main` that never finished into a failure (m16). Natively `exit_status` returns its argument.
5. **trystero's shared-connection track goes first** (`~/.buzz/PLANS/WEBCPP_TRYSTERO_SHARED_SPEC.md`,
   approved; its plan `~/.buzz/PLANS/WEBCPP_TRYSTERO_SHARED_PLAN.md`, worktree
   `~/dev/webcpp-trystero-shared`, branch `trystero-shared`): it moves connections, self ids and negotiations from
   the room to an `app`, in the files increment 3 changes. Increment 3 starts after that track
   has integrated, with a rebase onto it and a re-read of Task 31's table of call sites
   (I17); the table names today's functions, and the precondition before Task 31 maps each to
   where that track put it.
6. **asio's OpenSSL moves onto `/third_party//openssl`** (Task 25a, I14) once asio's Task 21
   is on the base; the asio plan's departure 4 names this move as webcpp::crypto's.

## Owner gates

Each is resolved by the controller with the owner before the task that needs it; until then the
plan is written with the controller's recommendation.

- **The force push of `main`** (before Task 0a, N3): the owner's pending act for the identity
  incident, which this plan waits on; not a decision the plan asks for. O1 itself is settled
  by the controller's ruling (n4): `infra/shared` integrates first, before config's Task 12.
- **O2, the heavy lanes and the owner's CI levels** (before Task 25b). Recommendation: this
  track builds the CI's nightly level for own lanes: `matrix.py own-lanes --level push|nightly`
  and a scheduled workflow that runs, each night and nothing else, the heavy own lanes
  (crypto's `c-suites`, `constant-time`, `browser`, `throughput`, and asio's `asyncify`, as
  the owner's asio decision puts it, N5), `runners.yml`, and the tools job's macOS and Windows
  legs; it reruns no library's ordinary lanes. Every push keeps the ordinary lanes, the Linux
  tools tests and the light own lanes (`sizes`, asio's `browser` and `tls`, trystero's,
  wasi's, xstate's).
- **O3, NIST's archives** (before Task 9). Recommendation: no public mirror; the two archives
  pinned by URL and SHA-256 (M3), fetched once into `.local/nist-cavp` by an action and a local
  script, as `.local/` holds what webcpp does not track; a mirror only if NIST moves or removes
  them.
- **O4 is no longer a gate** (the controller's ruling O4'): the user's Jamfiles are fixtures
  and a Python test of the tools (Task 10), and the tools job's `macos-15` and `windows-2022`
  legs, which ld64's and MSVC's messages need (spec 8.6), run `crypto_jamfiles_test.py
  --target native` at the nightly level (Task 25b): free minutes on the public repository,
  the cost being macOS concurrency and wall time, which every push would pay.
- **O5, the departures below** (before Task 22, Task 18 and Task 37): the owner's nod on each.
- **The machine-wide `brew install botan`** (before Task 37 Step 5), part of O5.

## Departures for the owner (O5)

1. **C17.** Sizes at b2's `speed` (`-O3`) and `space` (`-Os`) where spec 8.8 says -O2 and -Os:
   b2 has no -O2 that reaches the libraries a program names.
2. **C16.** webcpp's own throughput program in `runners.yml` in place of "the job of run
   38113681987", whose workflow no tree holds.
3. **C14.** MSVC's messages (`C1189`, `C2338`, `LNK2001`, `LNK2038`) checked by building the
   cases with MSVC in the tools test (its nightly Windows leg, O4') in place of the Compiler Explorer
   method, which calls a public service from the CI.
4. **`brew install botan`** on the development machine, for Botan's local runs (Task 37).

## Conflicts with the spec

Each is a place where the tree, a measurement or a rule of AGENTS.md disagrees with the
spec's prose, with this plan's ruling. The departures among them are listed above for the
owner (O5); C3 and C11 are owner gates O2 and O3.

| # | The spec says | The tree or a measurement says | Ruling |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | A program names `/third_party//<backend>` (sections 4, 7; AGENTS rule 5) | `infra/shared`'s `third_party/Jamfile` declares `project /webcpp/third_party`, and its consumers write `/webcpp/third_party//srell` | The Jamroot registers the one project under both ids (M1): `use-project /third_party : third_party ;` beside the existing line. The user's form is `/third_party//<name>`, as the owner's decision and AGENTS write it; `/webcpp/third_party//<name>` keeps working for SRELL's and the suite's consumers (Task 1) |
| C2 | The submodules go under `third_party/libs/` of the superproject | `main` had no `third_party/`; `infra/shared` has it and lags `main` by 54 commits (review C1) | `infra/shared` is rebased onto `main` and integrated first (Task 0a); this track bases on that `main` ("The base, the order of the tracks") |
| C3 | Each lane has a level: fast, nightly or release (section 8's table) | `matrix.py` has no level (M7) | Owner gate O2: this track builds the nightly level of the own lanes (Task 25b); the ordinary lanes run on every push until the levels' change |
| C4 | Constant time and throughput on Linux arm64 (sections 8.3, 8.8) | The matrix has no arm64 lane (M7) | The library's workflow `runners.yml` runs them on `ubuntu-24.04-arm`, beside `ubuntu-24.04` and `macos-15` (Task 22) |
| C5 | On macOS the counting test interposes the C library's allocator through `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` (section 8.5) | Linking the interposer into the program, loaded at launch, counts the same (M5) | The test links the interposer as a shared library of its own; no environment variable, which `webcpp.run` cannot set (Task 16) |
| C6 | Static OpenSSL is `lib/libcrypto.a` under the root; "with MSVC the library is `libcrypto.lib` in `lib/VC/x64/MD`" (section 4.4) | The CI's `.local/openssl` holds only the shared libraries (M7); on Windows `libcrypto.lib` in `lib/VC/x64/MD` is the import library of the DLL | The OpenSSL action also links `libcrypto.a` where the prefix holds it, and on Windows copies the installer's static library; its name is measured on the Windows runner first (Task 11, with what happens when it is absent) |
| C7 | The exit test "passes only with that line" written by the resource after `main` (section 8.5) | `webcpp.run` judges by the exit status alone; `webcpp.example`'s comparison would count the program as an example | The resource writes the line and then ends the process with `_exit(0)`; `main` returns 3, so a cleanup that never frees everything fails the test, and the resource's destructor writes its line and ends with `_exit(4)` (Task 16) |
| C8 | Sizes and throughput go "into the report" (section 8.8) | `tools/report/report.py` writes a test matrix, which has no place for a table | The tables go to the job's summary and an artifact; the documentation's size table is regenerated from the sizes lane, whose WebAssembly rows (pinned toolchains) are checked byte for byte and whose native rows are reported (Task 22) |
| C9 | `webcpp.same-program <name> : <sources> : <library> : <targets>` (section 8.7) | A program of crypto also needs `/webcpp/crypto//crypto`, which is neither its source nor the library compared | One more, last parameter, `: <requirements> *`, the program's other libraries; the rule is b2 alone, two `exe`s and a comparison (Task 21) |
| C10 | Section 7's Jamfiles were "built and run with b2" and section 8.6's stops are "run on a fixture project" | The lint refuses b2's raw `exe` in a library's `test/` and `example/` Jamfiles, `tools/test/fixtures/<x>/test/` included (AGENTS chapter 6, "raw b2 rules") | The existing pattern (owner item O4): fixtures `tools/test/fixtures/crypto_jamfiles/<case>/`, a user's Jamfile each, outside the raw-rules pattern, built by `tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py` on a scratch superproject as `emscripten_test.py` builds its fixtures (Task 10; the cases in Tasks 11, 16, 18, 24, 29, 37) |
| C11 | NIST CAVP's `gcmtestvectors` and AESAVS (section 8.1) | Published as zip archives on csrc.nist.gov only (M3); AGENTS rule 1's mirror is for C libraries, not test data | Owner gate O3: the archives pinned by URL and SHA-256, fetched into `.local/nist-cavp` by an action and a script, no repository (Task 9) |
| C12 | BIP340's `test-vectors.csv` (section 8.1) | It lives only in `bitcoin/bips` (M6) | A shallow submodule `third_party/libs/bips` at `927b6de9` (Task 28) |
| C13 | `webcpp.external crypto : OpenSSL ...` sits in `third_party/Jamfile` (section 4.4) | The index's "left out" reads the declarations of every library's `build.jam`, which the Jamroot loads at start (`tools/webcpp.jam` `left-out`); `third_party/Jamfile` loads only when a target names it | The declaration is in `libs/crypto/build.jam`; `third_party/Jamfile` reads the root through a new `webcpp.external-root` (Task 11) |
| C14 | MSVC's `C1189` text is checked "by the Compiler Explorer probe's method" (section 8.6) | That method calls a public service from the CI, unpinned | The tools test builds the same cases with MSVC on the tools job's nightly Windows leg (O4', Task 25b), its outcome holding `C1189` and the message (Task 18); departure 3 for the owner |
| C15 | Every suite runs with exceptions on and off (section 8) | No lane of the matrix builds without exceptions | The test Jamfile's rule `crypto-run` declares each program twice, the second `<exception-handling>off` with the suffix `_no_exceptions` (Task 1 onwards); Botan's with exceptions only |
| C16 | The throughput job is "the one of run 38113681987" (section 8.8) | No tree holds that job's workflow (searched `~/.buzz`, `~/dev/webcpp`) | `runners.yml` runs webcpp's own throughput program, built by b2, on the same three runners (Task 22) |
| C17 | Sizes at -O2 and -Os (section 8.8) | b2's `<optimization>speed` is `-O3` with clang and gcc, and b2 has no -O2 that reaches the libraries a program names (`<cflags>` is free and not propagated) | The table measures `<variant>release` at `speed` and at `space`, what a user's b2 builds, and the documentation names the flags (Task 22) |

## Global Constraints

**Repositories and paths:**
- `~/dev/webcpp` is the superproject (M). This track works in the worktree
  `~/dev/webcpp-crypto`, branch `lib/crypto`, based on asio's Task 2 on top of `main` after
  the force push and Task 0a ("The base, the order of the tracks", points 0 to 3), its `.local`
  a link to M's. Every rebase is `git -c user.name=R -c user.email=github.overboard312@passmail.net
  rebase`, followed by the identity check of point 3.
- `~/dev/webcpp-crypto/libs/crypto` is the library's own git repository, created in Task 1,
  branch `main`. Until the owner creates `webcpporg/crypto` and the submodule is added (gates
  G1, G2), the superproject ignores it through `.git/info/exclude` (the common git directory's,
  shared by M's worktrees), never through a tracked line.
- trystero (increment 3) is changed in `~/dev/webcpp-crypto/libs/trystero`, its own
  repository, on a branch `crypto` of it.
- Every b2 command runs from `~/dev/webcpp-crypto`, as
  `env -u CPATH -u CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH -u C_INCLUDE_PATH b2 --user-config=.local/user-config.jam ...`
  (written `$B2` below). A verdict is `-a`. Each lane has its own `--build-dir`. No cap on concurrent builds (owner, 2026-10-11): a test that fails under load is flaky and is fixed, never protected by running less at once.
- The lanes, as the CI runs them:
  - native: `$B2 -a --build-dir=bin/lane-native libs/crypto/test libs/crypto/example`;
  - wasip2: `$B2 -a --build-dir=bin/lane-wasip2 toolset=clang-wasip2 testing.launcher=wasmtime libs/crypto/test libs/crypto/example`;
  - wasip3: the same with `clang-wasip3` and `bin/lane-wasip3`;
  - emscripten: `$B2 -a --build-dir=bin/lane-emscripten toolset=emscripten libs/crypto/test libs/crypto/example`;
  - gcc: `$B2 -a --build-dir=bin/lane-gcc toolset=gcc-15 libs/crypto/test libs/crypto/example`;
  - an own lane `<lane>` on target `<t>`: the target's lane command with
    `libs/crypto/test//<lane>` (or the directory that declares it) in place of the two
    directories; every own lane of crypto names its targets (I2), so that the CI runs it on
    each;
  - the user's Jamfiles: `python3 tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py` (Task 10), which the
    superproject's tools job runs.
- The lint: `tools/lint/lint.sh --clang-format .local/wasi-sdk/bin/clang-format --clang-tidy .local/wasi-sdk/bin/clang-tidy`,
  ending `lint: clean`.

**The library's rules (AGENTS.md chapters 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11; the spec):**
- Names: namespace `webcpp::crypto`, `webcpp::crypto::backends`, `webcpp::crypto::secp256k1`;
  `detail` for what is not public; macros `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_*`, test macros `WEBCPP_TEST_*`;
  include guards `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_<PATH>_HPP` (`WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DETAIL_CANARY_H` for the C
  header); b2 target `/webcpp/crypto//crypto`; error category `webcpp.crypto`; `snake_case`.
- `<webcpp/crypto/config.hpp>` first in every public header, with `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_NO_EXCEPTIONS`;
  an API that throws sits behind `#ifndef WEBCPP_CRYPTO_NO_EXCEPTIONS` and raises through
  `boost::throw_exception`, never a bare `throw`.
- Every line of a library header that names `random_device`, `getentropy`, `RAND_bytes`,
  `<sys/random.h>` or `<unistd.h>` says why after `lint-world:` (M7), the class's own name
  included: `// lint-world: random_device reads the system's entropy, its purpose`.
- Every operation that can fail returns `boost::system::result<T>`; the values of `error` are
  those of spec section 2.9, fixed, never reused.
- Data, keys and outputs are `std::span<std::uint8_t const>` and `std::span<std::uint8_t>`;
  sizes `std::size_t`; a limit wider than `size_t` on wasm32 is `std::uint64_t`, compared
  through `detail::exceeds(std::uint64_t, std::uint64_t)` so that no comparison is
  tautological on wasm32 (clang's `-Wtautological-constant-out-of-range-compare`, an error
  under `<warnings-as-errors>on`).
- No allocation in webcpp's code but `keypair::make`'s context, in the resource it is given.
  No global or static mutable state in a header. A test's counters and replaced allocation
  functions are global, each line with
  `// NOLINTNEXTLINE(cppcoreguidelines-avoid-non-const-global-variables)` and the reason.
- A function starts with its guards. A comment says what the code does not. Doc Comments: a
  one-sentence brief, `@param`, `@tparam`, `@return`, only the allowed commands; every
  public symbol documented.
- `(max)()`, `(min)()` and `(std::numeric_limits<T>::max)()` in every header (spec 2.2).
- Tests use `<boost/core/lightweight_test.hpp>` and `test/require.hpp` (xactor's), and end
  `return webcpp::test::exit_status(boost::report_errors());` with
  `#include <webcpp/test/exit_status.hpp>` (asio's Task 2, on the base from Task 0, N2; under
  node it bounds the test and fails a `main` that never finished; natively it returns its
  argument); every code block of this plan does. Every test
  program is declared through the test Jamfile's `crypto-run` (C15), on every target its backend has.
- A message's test is a `webcpp.compile-diagnostic` in a directory of its own (spec 4.3's
  pitfall), whose source states the whole text on the header that raises it, as wasi's tests
  do: `// expected-error@webcpp/crypto/<header>:* {{<the text>}}`; on MSVC the same case is a
  fixture of `tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py` (C14).

**Commits and text:**
- Every commit is `git -c user.name=R -c user.email=github.overboard312@passmail.net commit -m "<message>" -- <paths>`
  (in the library `git -C libs/crypto -c user.name=R -c user.email=github.overboard312@passmail.net commit ...`,
  in trystero `git -C libs/trystero ...`), with no trailer of any kind and never an agent
  co-author. After each, `git log -1 --format='%an %ae %cn %ce'` prints
  `R github.overboard312@passmail.net R github.overboard312@passmail.net` and
  `git log -1 --format=%B | git interpret-trailers --parse` prints nothing.
- Stage by path: a new file is added first, `git add -- <new paths>`, since
  `commit -- <paths>` refuses a path git does not track (m9). Never `git add -A`, `git add .`
  or `git add libs`.
- Subjects: `crypto: <what>` in the library; `third_party: <what>`, `tools: <what>`,
  `Jamroot: <what>`, `tools/ci: <what>`, `AGENTS.md: <what>` in the superproject;
  `trystero: <what>` in trystero.
- Everything written to a file is English. No em dash (U+2014) anywhere. The word the lint's
  banned-word rule matches (`tools/lint/rules.py`) appears nowhere, in files or commits.
- Every source file opens with the licence notice (`//` for C++ and AsciiDoc, `/* */` for C,
  `#` for Jam, Python, shell and YAML, `<!-- -->` for HTML, `//` for JavaScript).
- No environment variable is ever printed (no bare `env`, `export`, `printenv`, `set`).

**Gates (the controller alone, each with the owner's agreement first; never a subagent):**
- **G1:** the owner creates `webcpporg/crypto`, public, BSL-1.0.
- **G2:** the owner adds the submodule `git submodule add ../crypto.git libs/crypto`, and the
  exclude line goes.
- **G3:** none any more: NIST's archives are pinned by URL and SHA-256 (owner gate O3); a
  mirror repository is made only if the owner asks.
- **G4:** pushes: the library, trystero, then the superproject.

**Names fixed by this plan:**

| Name | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `/webcpp/crypto//crypto` | the library: `include`, Boost's headers, and on Windows `bcrypt` |
| `/third_party//bearssl`, `//openssl`, `//ctaes`, `//secp256k1`, `//botan` | the backends' libraries (spec 4.1, 4.4) |
| `/third_party//wycheproof`, `//nist-cavp`, `//bips` | test data: a define naming the directory, and the directory under wasmtime |
| `webcpp-crypto-openssl-link`, `webcpp-crypto-botan-link` | `shared` (default) or `static`, propagated |
| `webcpp-secp256k1-tables` | `auto` (default), `small`, `large`, propagated |
| `webcpp-own` | `on`, optional, incidental, propagated: set by every webcpp test and example rule |

| `webcpp.external-looked <owner> : <library> : <properties> *` | where it looked and did not find it, or nothing |
| `webcpp.same-program <name> : <sources> + : <library> : <targets> * : <requirements> *` | a test: `<sources>` built with and without `<library>` under one output name, byte-identical, in b2 (`tools/same_program/same_program.jam`) |

| `~/dev/webcpp-crypto/.superpowers/sdd/WEBCPP_CRYPTO_PLAN/progress.md` | the ledger |

## Review Focus

1. **A one-shot `seal` or `open` while an incremental message is in progress.** The spec lists
   `invalid_state` for `begin_seal` during a message and for `update` or `result` without one,
   and is silent on the one-shot calls. Both re-initialise the backend's context, so letting
   them run would silently abandon the message, whose encrypted pieces then get a tag of
   another message. A reasonable person expects a refusal that leaves both the call's `data`
   and the message as they were: `invalid_state`, the message still in progress, its
   `result()` still correct. Task 8 tests it on BearSSL, Task 12 on OpenSSL, Task 38 on Botan.
2. **Spans that alias.** A wire format that appends the tag (trystero's, WebCrypto's) invites
   an `open` whose `tag` is a subspan right after `data`, or overlapping its end, and a `seal`
   whose IV or additional data sits in the same buffer. A failed `open` zeroes `data`, which
   would wipe an overlapping tag while the backend reads it, and in-place decryption would
   overwrite an overlapping IV. Expected: correct results when the spans touch, and an
   overlapping tag is an `authentication_failed` with `data` zeroed and nothing else
   corrupted. `gcm` and `chacha20_poly1305` copy the tag into a local array and consume the IV
   and the additional data before the first byte of `data` is written; Task 7 tests adjacent
   and overlapping spans.
3. **Empty inputs.** An empty plaintext with empty additional data (GCM case 1), an `update`
   with an empty span, `fill` of 0 bytes, `equal` of two empty spans, `encrypt` of zero
   blocks, a span whose `data()` is null. OpenSSL reads `EVP_EncryptUpdate` with a null output
   as additional data, and BearSSL and Botan take a null pointer with length 0 differently;
   every backend must give the same tag. Tasks 3, 4, 7, 8 and 12 test them on each backend.
4. **Two translation units that choose different default backends.** One file compiled with
   `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_BEARSSL` and one without, with OpenSSL linked, makes
   `aes256_gcm` two types under one name; a function of the program's that names it in a
   header is then an ODR violation that links silently. A reasonable person expects layer 3's
   kind of net: `<webcpp/crypto/aes256_gcm.hpp>` carries
   `#pragma detect_mismatch("webcpp_crypto_default_backend", "<name>")` on MSVC, which fails
   such a program with LNK2038, and the documentation says to give the define in the project's
   requirements. Task 14 adds it and Task 18 tests it on MSVC.
5. **OpenSSL on a second thread under the memory option.** A thread that has never touched
   OpenSSL's error queue makes, seals and opens; its first `ERR_*` call would allocate the
   thread's error state (6 blocks, PROBE-R3 `errmark.log`). Expected: `make` may allocate
   through the resource (its mark), `seal` and `open` allocate nothing on that thread, and
   the counts and the exit check hold. Task 16 tests it.
6. **Moving an object that was moved from** (I1). `aead c = std::move(b)` with `b` already
   empty, a move-assignment from it, `std::swap` of an empty and a live object: BearSSL's move
   would run `br_gcm_init` through a wiped, null vtable. Expected: the destination is empty
   too, and every function of both answers `invalid_state`. Tasks 7, 12, 29, 35 and 38 test it
   on every type and backend.
7. **A lane or a check that passes having built nothing** (I2, I11). An own lane that names no
   target runs natively only; a `make` whose sources a target skips is skipped whole and the
   lane is green. Expected: every own lane names its targets, and a lane that builds nothing on
   a target it names fails. Tasks 5, 22 and 25 test it.
8. **A constant-time tool that cannot give a verdict** (I8, I9). A harness that reports the
   library's public branch on a tag's verdict, or dudect classes that differ by outcome,
   fail every run whatever the code. Expected: the verdict is declassified where webcpp's code
   branches on it, each harness fails on a planted leak, and dudect's classes differ only in
   the secret. Task 20 tests it.
9. **A root given to a case that must not find the library** (I5). The CI gives
   `-sOPENSSL_ROOT` to its lanes; a "not found" case that saw it would find OpenSSL. Expected:
   each case of the user's Jamfiles states the roots it gets, and no other reaches it. Task 10
   tests it.
10. **Allocation outside webcpp's sight** (I3, I14). A `malloc` in C code never reaches
   `operator new`, and a program with a static libcrypto and a shared libssl holds two
   libcryptos. Expected: the allocation tests count the C library's allocator where a program
   can see it, with a control that moves the counter, and `/third_party//openssl` gives libssl
   and libcrypto as one choice. Tasks 11, 17 and 33 test it.

# Increment 1: the foundation, and AES-GCM on BearSSL and OpenSSL

## Task 0a: `infra/shared` integrated into `main` first (controller)

The controller's rulings on review findings C1, N3 and n4 and owner item O1: the crypto track
never starts from the stale `infra/shared`, nor from a `main` that holds the 13 commits of the
identity incident. This task runs the shared infrastructure plan's own "Integration" section
(`~/.buzz/PLANS/WEBCPP_SHARED_INFRA_PLAN.md`, "Integration (controller)", steps 1 to 5) on
`main` after the owner's force push ("The base, the order of the tracks", point 0), before any
other task of this plan, and before config's Task 12.

- [ ] **Step 1: The gates.**
  - The force push is done: in `~/dev/webcpp`, after `git fetch origin`,
    the identity check of "The base, the order of the tracks", point 3, on `origin/main`
    gives `identity: ok`:

```bash
cd ~/dev/webcpp && git fetch origin
test "$(git log --format='%an %ae %cn %ce' origin/main | grep -vc '^R github.overboard312@passmail.net R github.overboard312@passmail.net$')" = 0 \
  && ! git merge-base --is-ancestor f7c96d3 origin/main \
  && echo 'identity: ok' || echo 'identity: stop'
test -z "$(git log --oneline origin/main..main ^f7c96d3)" && echo 'local main: nothing of its own'
git switch main && git reset --hard origin/main
```

    Local `main` still holds the 13 old commits after the force push, so what must be empty
    before the reset is what it holds beyond both `origin/main` and those commits
    (`origin/main..main ^f7c96d3`, r1; empty on 2026-10-11 against `fix/ci-site`, the force
    push's target); the reset runs only after both lines print. Until they do, this plan
    waits, and its ledger says so.
  - The infra plan's step 1, its stage-4 half: the stage-4 ledger shows no task dispatched or
    committing to the superproject (its last line is a `complete`). Its config half does not
    apply: by the controller's ruling (n4), `infra/shared` integrates before config's Task 12,
    and config rebases onto `main` after it. The ruling and the time of the check go into the
    infra, config and stage-4 ledgers and this plan's.
- [ ] **Step 2: Rebase** onto that `main`, the infra plan's step 2:

```bash
cd ~/dev/webcpp-infra
git -C ~/dev/webcpp rev-parse main            # recorded in the ledger
git checkout -B infra/integrate infra/shared  # Task 5 (SRELL) is complete on infra/shared
git -c user.name=R -c user.email=github.overboard312@passmail.net rebase main
test "$(git log --format='%an %ae %cn %ce' infra/integrate | grep -vc '^R github.overboard312@passmail.net R github.overboard312@passmail.net$')" = 0 \
  && ! git merge-base --is-ancestor f7c96d3 infra/integrate \
  && echo 'identity: ok' || echo 'identity: stop'
```

  Expected: `identity: ok` from the identity check over the whole history
  (`infra/shared` holds none of the 13 commits: its history printed `0` on 2026-10-11, its
  fork point from `main` being `14a5191`, before them; a rebase that would replay one of them
  is aborted and reported). A
  conflict is resolved as that section says (additions kept from both sides), then the task's
  own tests run again. If the SRELL mirror's publication (that plan's Task 7) is not done, the
  rebase stops at Task 4's commit, as that section's step 2 shows, and
  `third_party/libs/srell` waits; this plan needs none of SRELL.
- [ ] **Step 3: The changelog and the check,** that section's steps 3 and 4: every lane from
  scratch, every own lane `python3 tools/ci/matrix.py own-lanes` lists, the lint, the tools'
  tests. Expected: all green; a failure is fixed on `infra/integrate` first, in its own
  commit.
- [ ] **Step 4: Integrate,** that section's step 5:
  `git -C ~/dev/webcpp -c user.name=R -c user.email=github.overboard312@passmail.net merge --ff-only infra/integrate`.
  Nothing is pushed (the owner's go, gate G4). The asio track then rebases its branch onto
  this `main` (its controller), as "The base, the order of the tracks" says.
- [ ] **Step 5: Measure M7 again on `main`**, into this plan's ledger:
  `grep -c 'rule external\b' tools/webcpp.jam` (1 or more), `grep -n 'rule data ( directories + )' tools/webcpp.jam`
  (one line), `git ls-tree main libs/trystero` (a submodule), `ls third_party/Jamfile
  tools/test/external_test.py tools/ci/actions/openssl/install.sh` (all three),
  `grep -n '^project' third_party/Jamfile` (`project /webcpp/third_party ;`). Any missing one
  stops the track and is reported.

## Task 0: The worktree, the ledger and the baseline

**Files:**
- Create: `~/dev/webcpp-crypto/.superpowers/sdd/WEBCPP_CRYPTO_PLAN/progress.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Make the worktree on asio's Task 2** (N2, "The base, the order of the
  tracks", point 3): the rebased `asio` branch, which holds `main` after Task 0a, at the commit
  asio's ledger records as Task 2's last, or `main` itself once asio has integrated. Every
  submodule from its usual place (the shared infrastructure's two from their local clones, as
  that plan's "Consumer interface" does until SRELL's mirror is published):

```bash
BASE=<the commit: asio's Task 2 on the rebased asio branch, or main once asio integrated>
git -C ~/dev/webcpp merge-base --is-ancestor main "$BASE" || echo 'asio is not on main: stop'
git -C ~/dev/webcpp worktree add ~/dev/webcpp-crypto -b lib/crypto "$BASE"
test "$(git -C ~/dev/webcpp-crypto log --format='%an %ae %cn %ce' HEAD | grep -vc '^R github.overboard312@passmail.net R github.overboard312@passmail.net$')" = 0 \
  && ! git -C ~/dev/webcpp-crypto merge-base --is-ancestor f7c96d3 HEAD \
  && echo 'identity: ok' || echo 'identity: stop'
ls ~/dev/webcpp-crypto/tools/node-test/include/webcpp/test/exit_status.hpp
git -C ~/dev/webcpp-crypto -c protocol.file.allow=always \
  -c submodule.third_party/libs/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite.url="$HOME/.buzz/REPOS/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite" \

  submodule update --init
git -C ~/dev/webcpp-crypto submodule status
ln -s ~/dev/webcpp/.local ~/dev/webcpp-crypto/.local
```

  Expected: no `stop` line, `identity: ok`, the header listed (a missing one
  stops the task: asio's Task 2 is not on the base, and Task 1 cannot write a test), one line
  per submodule without a leading `-` or `+`, `libs/trystero` among them; `ls -l .local`
  shows the link. The base's commit goes into the ledger.
- [ ] **Step 2: Create the ledger** with the first line
  `# SDD ledger - plan: ~/.buzz/PLANS/WEBCPP_CRYPTO_PLAN.md`.
- [ ] **Step 3: Record the baseline** in the ledger, each with its output:
  - `git -C ~/dev/webcpp-crypto rev-parse HEAD` (expected: Step 1's base);
  - `grep -n 'rule data ( directories + )' tools/webcpp.jam` (one line) and
    `grep -n '^project' third_party/Jamfile` (expected: `project /webcpp/third_party ;`);
  - `$B2 -d0 declared-targets` and `$B2 -d0 declared-lanes`;
  - `.local/wasi-sdk/bin/clang --version | head -1`, `wasmtime --version` (47.0.3),
    `.local/emsdk/upstream/emscripten/em++ --version | head -1` (6.0.11),
    `.local/emscripten/node --version` (v26.7.0),
    `ls .local/openssl/include/openssl/evp.h .local/openssl/lib`;
  - the lint: expected `lint: clean`; the native lane of trystero
    (`$B2 -a --build-dir=bin/lane-native libs/trystero/test`): expected all passed.
  A failure found here is fixed first, in its own commit, as AGENTS.md chapter 10 asks.

## Task 1: The library's skeleton, the second project id and the test Jamfile's rule

**Files:**
- Create (in `libs/crypto`, a new git repository): `LICENSE_1_0.txt` (the superproject's),
  `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`,
  `meta/libraries.json`, `meta/include-boundaries.json`, `build.jam`,
  `include/webcpp/crypto.hpp`, `include/webcpp/crypto/config.hpp`, `test/Jamfile`,
  `test/config_test.cpp`, `test/require.hpp`, `test/.clang-tidy`, `example/Jamfile`,
  `example/.clang-tidy`, `doc/Jamfile`, `doc/crypto.adoc`, `doc/overview.adoc`,
  `doc/testing.adoc`, `doc/mrdocs.yml`.
- Modify (superproject): `Jamroot` (one `use-project` line), `tools/test/jamroot_test.py`
  (one case), the common git directory's `info/exclude` (`/libs/crypto/`).

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: the project `/webcpp/crypto` and its alias `crypto`; the macros
  `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_NO_EXCEPTIONS` and `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_WEBASSEMBLY`; the forward declarations
  `webcpp::crypto::backends::{bearssl, openssl, ctaes, secp256k1, botan}`; the project id
  `/third_party`; the test Jamfile's rule `crypto-run <name> : <sources> + : <requirements> * : <targets> *`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tools test.** In `tools/test/jamroot_test.py`, a case that
  builds a scratch alias through each id:

```python
def test_third_party_has_both_ids(root):
    # A user's Jamfile names /third_party//<name> (AGENTS.md chapter 6, rule 5); the libraries
    # of the shared infrastructure name /webcpp/third_party//<name>: both reach one project.
    (root / 'third_party').mkdir(exist_ok=True)
    (root / 'third_party/Jamfile').write_text(
        'project /webcpp/third_party ;\n\nalias probe : : : : <define>WEBCPP_TEST_PROBE=1 ;\n'
        'explicit probe ;\n')
    harness.add_library(root, 'ids', 'alias one : /third_party//probe ;\n'
                        'alias two : /webcpp/third_party//probe ;\n', {})
    result = harness.run_b2(root, '-n', 'libs/ids/test//one', 'libs/ids/test//two')
    harness.expect(result, True)
```

  and add it to `CASES`. Run `python3 tools/test/jamroot_test.py test_third_party_has_both_ids`.
  Expected: FAIL, "Unable to find file or target named '/third_party//probe'".
- [ ] **Step 2: Register the id.** In the Jamroot, after
  `use-project /webcpp/third_party : third_party ;`:

```jam
# The same project under the id a user's Jamfile writes, /third_party//<name>
# (AGENTS.md chapter 6, "Bringing a C library into webcpp"): b2 resolves
# both ids to the one Jamfile.
use-project /third_party : third_party ;
```

  Run the case again. Expected: PASS.
- [ ] **Step 3: Create the repository.**

```bash
mkdir -p libs/crypto && git -C libs/crypto init -b main
cp LICENSE_1_0.txt libs/crypto/
echo /libs/crypto/ >> "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/info/exclude"
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Write the failing test** `test/config_test.cpp`, pratt's with the names
  changed, plus the classification of the target:

```cpp

// build has no exceptions, keeps the developer's own definition, and defines
// WEBCPP_CRYPTO_WEBASSEMBLY exactly on wasip2, wasip3 and Emscripten. test/Jamfile

#error "WEBCPP_CRYPTO_WEBASSEMBLY is not defined exactly on WebAssembly"
#endif

int main() {
    return 0;
}
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Write `build.jam`:**

```jam

# accompanying file LICENSE_1_0.txt or copy at

#
# crypto: authenticated encryption, randomness and secp256k1 over C backends.
# A program names /webcpp/crypto//crypto and the library of each backend it
# uses, /third_party//<backend> (third_party/Jamfile):

# tag::crypto[]
alias crypto : : : : <include>include <library>/boost//headers
  <target-os>windows:<find-shared-library>bcrypt ;
# end::crypto[]
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Write `include/webcpp/crypto/config.hpp`.** This step writes the part every
  later task builds on; Task 6 adds the backends' refusals and the default.

```cpp

#endif  // WEBCPP_CRYPTO_HPP
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Write `test/Jamfile`** with the rule every later task uses (C15):

```jam

#
# Distributed under the Boost Software License, Version 1.0. (See
# accompanying file LICENSE_1_0.txt or copy at

project : requirements <library>/webcpp/crypto//crypto ;

import webcpp ;

webcpp.targets native wasip2 wasip3 emscripten ;

# Every test runs with exceptions on and off (DESIGN, 2026-10-10 "every
# variant tested"): the second program has the suffix _no_exceptions and is
# built with exception-handling=off, which links tools/throw_exception.cpp.
rule crypto-run ( name : sources + : requirements * : targets * )
{
    webcpp.run $(name) : $(sources) : $(requirements) : $(targets) ;
    webcpp.run $(name)_no_exceptions : $(sources)
      : $(requirements) <exception-handling>off : $(targets) ;
}

webcpp.headers-alone crypto : ../include : crypto.hpp crypto/config.hpp ;

# config.hpp defines WEBCPP_CRYPTO_NO_EXCEPTIONS exactly when the build has no
# exceptions, keeps it when a developer defines it, and classifies the target.
crypto-run config : config_test.cpp ;
webcpp.run config_developer_defined : config_test.cpp
  : <define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_NO_EXCEPTIONS <define>WEBCPP_TEST_CRYPTO_DEVELOPER_DEFINED ;
```

  `test/require.hpp` is xactor's (`libs/xactor/test/require.hpp`) with the guard
  `WEBCPP_TEST_CRYPTO_REQUIRE_HPP`. `test/.clang-tidy` and `example/.clang-tidy` are
  xactor's, with their comments. `example/Jamfile`:

```jam
# Copyright (c) 2026 WebCpp.org
#
# Distributed under the Boost Software License, Version 1.0. (See
# accompanying file LICENSE_1_0.txt or copy at
# https://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt)

project : requirements <library>/webcpp/crypto//crypto ;

import webcpp ;

webcpp.targets native wasip2 wasip3 emscripten ;
```

- [ ] **Step 8: Run** `$B2 -a --build-dir=bin/lane-native libs/crypto/test`. Expected: PASS,
  `alone-crypto`, `alone-crypto-config`, `config`, `config_no_exceptions`,
  `config_developer_defined`. Then the wasip2 and emscripten lanes. Expected: PASS, the
  same five.
- [ ] **Step 9: Write the repository's files:**
  - `meta/libraries.json`:

```json
{
    "key": "crypto",
    "name": "crypto",
    "authors": ["R"],
    "description": "Authenticated encryption, randomness and secp256k1 for C++20 on every target, over BearSSL, OpenSSL, ctaes, libsecp256k1 and Botan.",
    "category": ["Cryptography"],
    "maintainers": ["R <github.overboard312@passmail.net>"],
    "cxxstd": "20",
    "port-of": null
}
```

  - `meta/include-boundaries.json`, which keeps the backend-free headers free of every C
    library:

```json
{
    "boundaries": [
        {
            "headers": ["include/webcpp/crypto/config.hpp", "include/webcpp/crypto/error.hpp", "include/webcpp/crypto/equal.hpp", "include/webcpp/crypto/random_device.hpp", "include/webcpp/crypto/aes.hpp", "include/webcpp/crypto/gcm.hpp", "include/webcpp/crypto/chacha20_poly1305.hpp"],
            "must-not-include": ["bearssl", "openssl/", "ctaes", "secp256k1", "botan/", "webcpp/crypto/backends/"],
            "why": "a program that only draws random bytes or compares tags names no backend library (spec section 2.2)"
        }
    ]
}
```

  - `.gitignore`: `doc/html/`, `node_modules`, `.node-modules/`;
  - `.gitattributes`: pratt's two lines (`* text=auto eol=lf`, `*.bat text eol=crlf`);
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: pratt's, with `library: crypto`;
  - `README.md`: what crypto is (spec 1.1 in four sentences), the backends' table (spec 3.1's
    first four columns), how to build and test it in the superproject (the lane commands of
    Global Constraints), where its page is published
    (`https://webcpporg.github.io/webcpp/libs/crypto/`), its licence (BSL-1.0) and the
    backends' (BearSSL MIT, ctaes MIT, libsecp256k1 MIT, OpenSSL Apache-2.0, Botan
    BSD-2-Clause), and where OpenSSL is looked for (the text of spec 7.3's second paragraph);
  - `AGENTS.md`: pratt's opening paragraph; "What crypto is" (webcpp's own library over C
    backends, `"port-of": null`, no oracle); "Cautions": a backend's header supplies only the
    six traits, and every guard lives in the algorithm types; a test of a backend is a `.cpp`
    of its own per backend, never a define that changes the backend of one source (spec 4.3's
    pitfall); every C library is unchanged upstream code; a moved pin is a change of its own
    (AGENTS rule 12).
- [ ] **Step 10: Write the page.** `doc/Jamfile`:

```jam
# Copyright (c) 2026 WebCpp.org
#
# Distributed under the Boost Software License, Version 1.0. (See
# accompanying file LICENSE_1_0.txt or copy at
# https://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt)

import webcpp ;

webcpp.doc crypto : crypto.adoc ;
webcpp.reference crypto ;
```

  `doc/mrdocs.yml` is pratt's (`show-enum-constants: true`, the error's values being fixed).
  `doc/crypto.adoc` opens with the licence notice and the attributes of AGENTS.md chapter 8
  (`= crypto: authenticated encryption, randomness and secp256k1 for {cpp}`, `:toc: left`,
  `:toclevels: 1`, `:idprefix:`, `:sectanchors:`, `:example-caption!:`,
  `:attribute-missing: warn`), one paragraph (what crypto is, one of the libraries of webcpp),
  `include::overview.adoc[]`, `include::testing.adoc[]` and the reference section of
  AGENTS.md chapter 8. `overview.adoc` (`[#crypto-overview]`, "Why crypto") holds spec 1.1 and
  1.2 as prose. `testing.adoc` (`[#crypto-testing]`) says how crypto is tested: the lanes and
  their commands, `{n-tests}` tests, the report's address.
- [ ] **Step 11: Run** `$B2 -a --build-dir=bin/b-doc libs/crypto/doc`. Expected: PASS, the
  page written. Then the lint. Expected: `lint: clean`.
- [ ] **Step 12: Commit** (library), then (superproject):

```bash
git -C libs/crypto add -- LICENSE_1_0.txt README.md AGENTS.md .gitattributes .gitignore \
    .github meta build.jam include test example doc
git -C libs/crypto -c user.name=R -c user.email=github.overboard312@passmail.net commit \
    -m "crypto: the library's skeleton: its configuration, its page and its CI"
git -c user.name=R -c user.email=github.overboard312@passmail.net commit \
    -m "Jamroot: third_party also as /third_party, the id a user's Jamfile writes" \
    -- Jamroot tools/test/jamroot_test.py
```

## Task 2: The errors

**Files:**
- Create: `include/webcpp/crypto/error.hpp`, `test/error_test.cpp`.
- Modify: `test/Jamfile`, `include/webcpp/crypto.hpp` (the include).

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `enum class webcpp::crypto::error`, values 1 to 14 of spec 2.9;
  `webcpp::crypto::error_category()`; `webcpp::crypto::make_error_code(error)`;
  `boost::system::is_error_code_enum<webcpp::crypto::error>`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** `test/error_test.cpp`:

```cpp

    BOOST_TEST_EQ(static_cast<int>(error::memory_functions_refused), 13);

    boost::system::error_code const code = error::authentication_failed;
    BOOST_TEST_EQ(std::string_view(code.category().name()), "webcpp.crypto");
    BOOST_TEST(code.category() == crypto::error_category());

    boost::system::result<void> const failed = error::invalid_state;
    BOOST_TEST(!failed);
    BOOST_TEST(failed.error() == error::invalid_state);

    BOOST_TEST_EQ(crypto::make_error_code(error::memory_functions_refused).message(),
                  "OpenSSL's memory functions cannot be installed: OpenSSL has already allocated, "
                  "or another party installed its own. Call "
                  "backends::openssl::install_memory_functions() as the first statement of main, "
                  "before anything uses OpenSSL.");
    BOOST_TEST_EQ(crypto::make_error_code(error::memory_functions_not_installed).message(),
                  "OpenSSL's memory functions are not webcpp::crypto's. Call "
                  "backends::openssl::install_memory_functions() as the first statement of main, "
                  "and let nothing else call CRYPTO_set_mem_functions.");
    BOOST_TEST_EQ(crypto::make_error_code(static_cast<error>(99)).message(),
                  "unknown webcpp.crypto error");
    char buffer[8];
    BOOST_TEST_EQ(std::string_view(crypto::error_category().message(6, buffer, sizeof buffer)),
                  "the authentication tag does not match");
    return webcpp::test::exit_status(boost::report_errors());
}
```

  In `test/Jamfile`: `crypto-run error : error_test.cpp ;`. Run the native lane. Expected:
  FAIL, `webcpp/crypto/error.hpp` not found.
- [ ] **Step 2: Write `include/webcpp/crypto/error.hpp`**, trystero's form
  (`libs/trystero/include/webcpp/trystero/error.hpp`), each enumerator with a Doc Comment
  that says who raises it (spec 2.9's third column):

  `crypto.hpp` includes it on the line
  `#include <webcpp/crypto/random_device.hpp>  // lint-world: the system's entropy, a purpose of crypto`,
  and the headers-alone list gains `crypto/random_device.hpp`.
- [ ] **Step 5: Run** the four lanes. Expected: PASS: `random_device`,
  `random_device_failing` and their twins on every target; `random_device_no_call` on native
  and wasip2. On MSVC (the CI's lanes) the Windows branch compiles and fills.
- [ ] **Step 6: Write the lint rule** (spec 8.4's last item). Its failing case first, in
  `tools/lint/lint_test.py`, as the file's other cases do (a scratch tree with one header):
  a header `libs/x/include/webcpp/x/detail/entropy.hpp` holding the line
  `int r = rand();  // lint-world: a test` must fail, the lint printing what the rule below
  prints, the section `== entropy sources ==`, the line
  `libs/x/include/webcpp/x/detail/entropy.hpp:<line>:int r = rand();  // lint-world: a test: a header that reads entropy names rand, time, clock or __rdrand`
  and, at the end, `lint: failed: entropy sources`; and one holding only
  `int r = getentropy(p, 16);  // lint-world: a test` must pass. Run `python3 tools/lint/lint_test.py`.
  Expected: FAIL. Then in `tools/lint/lint.sh`, after rule 8:

```bash
# 8b. A header that reads entropy names no weaker source: no rand, time, clock or
#    __rdrand, even with lint-world:, in any header whose path ends entropy.hpp or
#    random_device.hpp (DESIGN, 2026-10-11 "entropy, safest and readable").
rule 'entropy sources'
weak='(^|[^_[:alnum:]])(s?rand|time|clock|__rdrand(16|32|64)?_step|__rdrand)[[:space:]]*\('
weak_found="$(grep -E '(entropy|random_device)\.hpp$' "${work_directory}/headers" \
    | while IFS= read -r header; do grep -nHE -e "${weak}" "${header}" || true; done)"
if [ -n "${weak_found}" ]; then
    printf '%s\n' "${weak_found}" \
        | sed 's/$/: a header that reads entropy names rand, time, clock or __rdrand/'
    fail "a header that reads entropy names a weaker source"
else
    printf 'no header that reads entropy names a weaker source\n'
fi
```

  Run the lint test again. Expected: PASS. Run the lint. Expected: `lint: clean`.
- [ ] **Step 7: Commit** (library) `"crypto: random_device on the system's one generator,
  in readable code"`; (superproject) `"tools: the lint refuses a weaker source in a header
  that reads entropy"` with `tools/lint/lint.sh tools/lint/lint_test.py`.

## Task 5: BearSSL from the mirror, file by file, with its canary

**Files:**
- Create (superproject): the submodule `third_party/libs/bearssl`;
  `tools/test/third_party_test.py`.
- Modify (superproject): `.gitmodules`, `third_party/Jamfile`.
- Create (library): `src/canary_bearssl.c`, `include/webcpp/crypto/detail/canary.h`,
  `test/c_suites/Jamfile`, `LICENSE-BEARSSL.txt`.
- Modify (library): `test/Jamfile` (`build-project c_suites ;`).

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `/third_party//bearssl` (usage requirements: `<include>third_party/libs/bearssl/inc`,
  `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_HAS_BEARSSL=1`, the section garbage collection); the symbol
  `webcpp_crypto_bearssl_7bea48e_<getentropy|noseeder>__add_third_party_bearssl_to_your_link`;
  the macros of `detail/canary.h`: `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DETAIL_CANARY(name, commit, configuration)`,
  `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DETAIL_MISMATCH_VALUE(name, commit, configuration)`,
  `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_BEARSSL_COMMIT` (`7bea48e`).

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the submodule** from the mirror, pinned:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/webcpporg/bearssl.git third_party/libs/bearssl
git -C third_party/libs/bearssl checkout 7bea48e5e850ab4cafbe68d3765cdaba13a86d6f
find third_party/libs/bearssl/src -name '*.c' | wc -l
```

  Expected: 294.
- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing test** `tools/test/third_party_test.py` (harness's style,
  run in the real superproject, since the archive is the point): it builds
  `/third_party//bearssl` natively with `-a -d+2 --build-dir=bin/third-party-test` and
  asserts that b2 compiled 295 C files (the 294 of `src/` and the canary; count the lines
  `clang -x c` or `gcc -x c` b2 prints at `-d+2`), that every one has
  `-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections`, `-DBR_RDRAND=0`, `-DBR_USE_URANDOM=0`,
  `-DBR_USE_GETENTROPY=1` and `-D_DEFAULT_SOURCE`, that none has `-std=`, and on macOS
  `-include sys/random.h`; then `nm` of the archive lists
  `webcpp_crypto_bearssl_7bea48e_getentropy__add_third_party_bearssl_to_your_link` (with the
  leading `_` on Mach-O). Run `python3 tools/test/third_party_test.py`. Expected: FAIL, no
  target `bearssl`.
- [ ] **Step 3: Write `include/webcpp/crypto/detail/canary.h`** (spec 4.3, readable as C and
  C++):

```c

- [ ] **Step 6: Write BearSSL's own suite** (spec 8.1, "the C libraries' own suites",
  AGENTS rule 11) in `test/c_suites/Jamfile`:

```jam
# Copyright (c) 2026 WebCpp.org
#
# Distributed under the Boost Software License, Version 1.0. (See
# accompanying file LICENSE_1_0.txt or copy at
# https://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt)

# The C libraries' own test programs, built against webcpp's build of each, on
# every target (AGENTS.md chapter 6, rule 11). BearSSL's 88 tests take 28 to
# 46 s per target, so they are the own lane c-suites, outside the ordinary
# lanes.
import webcpp ;

webcpp.targets native wasip2 wasip3 emscripten ;

path-constant BEARSSL : ../../../../third_party/libs/bearssl ;
webcpp.run bearssl_test_crypto : $(BEARSSL)/test/test_crypto.c
  : <library>/third_party//bearssl <include>$(BEARSSL)/src <warnings>off
    <warnings-as-errors>off <toolset>emscripten:<linkflags>-sSTACK_SIZE=1048576 ;

# The lane names its targets, so that the CI runs it on each (an own lane that
# names none runs natively alone, tools/webcpp.jam's lane rule).
webcpp.lane c-suites : bearssl_test_crypto : native wasip2 wasip3 emscripten ;
```

  In `test/Jamfile`, `build-project c_suites ;`. `LICENSE-BEARSSL.txt` is a copy of
  `third_party/libs/bearssl/LICENSE.txt`, which the README names.
- [ ] **Step 7: Run** `python3 tools/test/third_party_test.py`. Expected: PASS. Then the own
  lane on each target, e.g.
  `$B2 -a --build-dir=bin/lane-c-suites-wasip2 toolset=clang-wasip2 testing.launcher=wasmtime libs/crypto/test//c-suites`.
  Expected: PASS, `bearssl_test_crypto`'s output ending "All tests OK." (its own last line) on
  native, wasip2, wasip3 and emscripten. A test of BearSSL's that fails on a target is
  investigated as a build difference (a define, a dialect) before anything else; BearSSL's
  code is never changed. The Emscripten stack size is measured: start without
  `-sSTACK_SIZE`, and keep the line only if the run overflows Emscripten's 64 KiB default,
  with the measured size.
- [ ] **Step 8: Commit** (superproject)
  `"third_party: BearSSL from the mirror webcpporg/bearssl, built file by file with webcpp::crypto's canary"`
  (`.gitmodules third_party/libs/bearssl third_party/Jamfile tools/test/third_party_test.py`);
  (library) `"crypto: BearSSL's canary, and its own test suite on webcpp's build"`.

## Task 6: The configuration's refusals, the default backend, and BearSSL's three layers

**Files:**
- Modify: `include/webcpp/crypto/config.hpp`.
- Create: `include/webcpp/crypto/backends/bearssl.hpp` (its check and canary only; Task 7 adds
  its engines), `include/webcpp/crypto/detail/engines.hpp`,
  `test/messages/<case>/Jamfile` and `<case>.cpp` for the cases of Step 1.
- Modify: `test/Jamfile` (`build-project messages ;`), `test/messages/Jamfile`.

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `webcpp::crypto::default_backend`; the macros `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DETAIL_DEFAULT_<NAME>`
  and `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DETAIL_NONE_LINKED`; the primary templates
  `template <class Backend, std::size_t KeySize> struct block_state;`,
  `block_engine`, `gcm_state`, `gcm_engine` (same parameters) and
  `template <class Backend> struct chacha_state;`, `chacha_engine` (declared, never defined);
  `struct webcpp::crypto::backends::bearssl { static constexpr std::string_view name = "bearssl"; };`;
  `void webcpp::crypto::detail::read_canary(char const volatile&) noexcept`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing message tests,** one directory each (spec 4.3's pitfall),
  each a `webcpp.compile-diagnostic` whose source states the exact text. The cases and their
  requirements:

| Directory | Requirements | Targets | Expected error, stated on the header that raises it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `no_backend_wasm` | none | wasip2 wasip3 | spec 4.3's first row, the whole text |
| `no_backend_native` | none | native | spec 4.3's second row |
| `bearssl_not_linked` | `<define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_BEARSSL` | native wasip2 | spec 4.3's third row |
| `openssl_on_wasm` | `<define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_HAS_OPENSSL=1` | wasip2 wasip3 | spec 4.3's seventh row |
| `default_openssl_on_wasm` | `<define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_OPENSSL` | wasip2 wasip3 | spec 4.3's eighth row |
| `two_defaults` | `<define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_OPENSSL <define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_BEARSSL` | native | spec 4.3's ninth row |
| `memory_option_on_wasm` | `<define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_OPENSSL_MEMORY_RESOURCE` | wasip2 wasip3 | spec 3.7's first refusal |
| `memory_option_without_openssl` | `<define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_OPENSSL_MEMORY_RESOURCE` | native | spec 3.7's second refusal |

  Each source includes `<webcpp/crypto/backends/bearssl.hpp>` (the first three, through the
  default's header) or `<webcpp/crypto/config.hpp>` (the others), and states its error on the
  header that raises it, as wasi's tests do (`libs/wasi/test/neither_target_refused.cpp`):
  `// expected-error@webcpp/crypto/backends/bearssl.hpp:* {{...}}` for the first three,
  `// expected-error@webcpp/crypto/config.hpp:* {{...}}` for the others, each with the whole
  text. `no_backend_wasm.cpp`:

project : requirements <library>/webcpp/crypto//crypto ;

import webcpp ;

webcpp.compile-diagnostic no_backend_wasm : no_backend_wasm.cpp : : wasip2 wasip3 ;
```

  `test/messages/Jamfile` holds `build-project <case> ;` for each directory, and
  `test/Jamfile` `build-project messages ;`. Run the native and wasip2 lanes. Expected:
  FAIL, each case's header missing or its message absent.
- [ ] **Step 2: Complete `config.hpp`.** After `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_WEBASSEMBLY`:

```cpp

```

  and, after the backends' forward declarations, inside `namespace webcpp::crypto`:

```cpp
/** The backend of `aes256<>`, `gcm<aes256<>>` and `aes256_gcm`, as section 5 chooses it. */
#if defined(WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DETAIL_DEFAULT_OPENSSL)
using default_backend = backends::openssl;
#else
using default_backend = backends::bearssl;
#endif
```

  Each macro the program may define (`WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_BEARSSL`,
  `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_OPENSSL`, `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_OPENSSL_MEMORY_RESOURCE`,
  `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_HAS_<NAME>`) gets a Doc Comment under `#ifdef __MRDOCS__`, defined and
  undefined at once, as `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_NO_EXCEPTIONS`'s is.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run** the native and wasip2 lanes. Expected: PASS, each case of Step 1 on its
  targets, and the headers alone (`alone-crypto-backends-bearssl` gets
  `<library>/third_party//bearssl` in a headers-alone call of its own:
  `webcpp.headers-alone crypto : ../include : crypto/backends/bearssl.hpp : <library>/third_party//bearssl ;`;
  `detail/canary.h` is not a public `.hpp`, and naming it would stop the Jamfile (each glob of
  `only` must match a public header, I16): it is compiled through every backend header that
  includes it; `detail/engines.hpp`,
  `detail/entropy.hpp`, `detail/limits.hpp`, `detail/wipe.hpp` and `detail/windows.hpp` join
  the first call's list).
- [ ] **Step 6: Commit:** `"crypto: the configuration's refusals and the default backend,
  and BearSSL's three layers"`.

## Task 7: The block cipher's shape, and GCM one shot on BearSSL

**Files:**
- Create: `include/webcpp/crypto/aes.hpp`, `include/webcpp/crypto/gcm.hpp`,
  `test/support/hex.hpp`, `test/support/gcm_spec_vectors.hpp`, `test/support/gcm_checks.hpp`,
  `test/gcm_bearssl_test.cpp`, `test/messages/aes_on_bearssl/` (Jamfile and source).
- Modify: `include/webcpp/crypto/backends/bearssl.hpp` (the engines), `test/Jamfile`,
  `test/messages/Jamfile`, `include/webcpp/crypto.hpp`.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `detail::{block,gcm}_{state,engine}`, `detail::read_canary`, `detail::wipe`,
  `detail::exceeds`, `error`, `equal`.
- Produces: `aes128<Backend>`, `aes192<Backend>`, `aes256<Backend>` (spec 2.3) over
  `detail::basic_aes<KeySize, Backend>`; `gcm<Cipher>` (spec 2.4) with `seal` and `open`;
  for a backend, the engine contract every later backend follows:

```cpp
// A backend B with GCM specialises, for KeySize 16, 24 and 32:
template <> struct gcm_state<B, KeySize> { /* trivially movable through the engine */ };
template <> struct gcm_engine<B, KeySize> {
    static boost::system::result<void> init(gcm_state<B, KeySize>&, std::span<std::uint8_t const> key) noexcept;
    static boost::system::result<void> start(gcm_state<B, KeySize>&, bool sealing,
        std::span<std::uint8_t const> iv, std::span<std::uint8_t const> additional_data) noexcept;
    static boost::system::result<void> run(gcm_state<B, KeySize>&, std::span<std::uint8_t> data) noexcept;
    static boost::system::result<void> tag(gcm_state<B, KeySize>&, boost::hash2::digest<16>& out) noexcept;
    static boost::system::result<void> check(gcm_state<B, KeySize>&, std::array<std::uint8_t, 16> const& tag) noexcept;
    static void move(gcm_state<B, KeySize>& to, gcm_state<B, KeySize>& from) noexcept;  // to is empty
    static void reset(gcm_state<B, KeySize>&) noexcept;  // wipes and releases; the state is empty
};
// check returns error::authentication_failed or error::backend_failure; start and run may
// return backend_failure; init may return not_enough_memory, backend_failure or (OpenSSL
// under the option) memory_functions_not_installed.

  The last check compares the in-place seal with a seal of copies (review m3): `gcm` consumes
  the IV and the additional data before the first byte of `data` is written. Buffers start
  from patterns, never zero, so that "untouched" and "zeroed" are each checked against a value
  that differs (m3, m4). `test/gcm_bearssl_test.cpp`:

  `basic_aes` calls `engine::init(...)`, `engine::encrypt(...)` and `engine::decrypt(...)`
  without template arguments; on a backend whose engine has plain functions those are plain
  calls, and on BearSSL they deduce `Never = false` and fire the assertion. A
  `static_assert` whose condition depends on a template parameter is checked only when its
  template is instantiated.
- [ ] **Step 6: Write the message test** `test/messages/aes_on_bearssl/` (spec 2.3's text,
  native and wasip2): its source calls `aes256<backends::bearssl>::make(key)` and states
  `// expected-error@webcpp/crypto/backends/bearssl.hpp:* {{webcpp::crypto: aes256<backends::bearssl>: BearSSL exports AES only inside its modes, with no block cipher. Name a backend that exports it, as in aes256<backends::ctaes>, aes256<backends::openssl> or aes256<backends::botan>, and add its library to the program's Jamfile.}}`;
  its Jamfile names `<library>/third_party//bearssl`. A second source of the same directory,
  `gcm_names_aes_on_bearssl.cpp`, declared with `webcpp.compile`, names
  `gcm<aes256<backends::bearssl>>`, makes it and seals, and must compile: the block cipher's
  refusal does not reach GCM.
- [ ] **Step 7: Run** the four lanes. Expected: PASS, `gcm_bearssl` and its twin on every
  target, both message tests, and the headers alone of `aes.hpp` and `gcm.hpp` (in the first
  call's list: they include no backend).
- [ ] **Step 8: Commit:** `"crypto: the block cipher's shape, and AES-GCM one shot on
  BearSSL, every guard before the work"`.


## Task 8: The incremental seal, and the limits

**Files:**
- Modify: `include/webcpp/crypto/gcm.hpp` (`begin_seal`, `update`, `result`),
  `include/webcpp/crypto/backends/bearssl.hpp` (the engine's `abandon`),
  `test/support/gcm_checks.hpp` (the machine's checks), `test/gcm_bearssl_test.cpp`,
  `test/Jamfile`.
- Create: `test/support/reserved.hpp`, `test/gcm_limits_bearssl_test.cpp`.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 7's engine contract.
- Produces: `gcm::begin_seal(iv, additional_data)`, `gcm::update(data)`, `gcm::result()`
  (spec 2.4); one more member of every GCM engine:
  `static void abandon(gcm_state<B, KeySize>&) noexcept;` (the message's state wiped, the key
  kept); the checks `check_in_pieces(made, iv, additional_data, plaintext, ciphertext_hex, tag_hex, piece)`,
  `check_every_piece(...)` (the same without `piece`), `check_incremental<Backend>()` (I4: the 18
  cases, every piece size), `check_machine<Backend>()`,
  `check_one_shot_during_message<Backend>()` and `check_limits<Backend>()`;
  `std::span<std::uint8_t> webcpp::test::reserved(std::size_t)`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing checks** in `test/support/gcm_checks.hpp`:

```cpp
/**
 * Seals `plaintext` through the incremental seal in pieces of `piece` bytes (and one empty
 * piece), checks the ciphertext and the tag against the expected hex, and opens the result
 * one shot (spec 8.1: every case sealed incrementally as well).

            return error::invalid_state;
        }
        result_type tag{};
        auto const tagged = engine::tag(state_, tag);
        end_message();
        if (!tagged) {
            engine::abandon(state_);
            return tagged.error();
        }
        return tag;
    }
```

  and in the private part:

```cpp
    void abandon() noexcept {
        engine::abandon(state_);
        end_message();
    }
```

  `begin_seal`'s first guard is `in_message_` because a refused `begin_seal` during a
  message ends that message (spec 2.4, "any error from begin_seal ... ends the message");
  `guard_message` then refuses a moved-from object.
- [ ] **Step 3: Give BearSSL's engine `abandon`** (in `gcm_engine<backends::bearssl, K>`):

```cpp
    // The message's state is wiped and the context initialised again on the kept schedule.
    static void abandon(state& s) noexcept {
        wipe_object(s.context);
        br_gcm_init(&s.context, &s.keys.vtable, bearssl_ghash());
        s.sealing = false;
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run** the four lanes. Expected: PASS: `gcm_bearssl` (with the new checks) on
  every target; `gcm_limits_bearssl` natively, where the reservation of 64 GiB of address
  space succeeds on Linux, macOS and Windows (MSVC lanes), and the guards refuse before any
  byte is read: a guard that read would end the program with SIGSEGV or an access violation.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit:** `"crypto: GCM's incremental seal, its machine, and the limits
  refused before any byte is read"`.

## Task 9: Wycheproof and NIST CAVP, through BearSSL

Owner gate O3 is resolved before this task; it is written with the recommendation (no mirror:
NIST's archives pinned by URL and SHA-256). If the owner chooses the mirror instead, Step 1's
action is replaced by a submodule `third_party/libs/nist-cavp` of `webcpporg/nist-cavp`, and the
target of Step 3 reads that directory; nothing else of the task changes.

**Files:**
- Create (superproject): the submodule `third_party/libs/wycheproof`;
  `tools/ci/actions/nist-cavp/action.yml`, `tools/ci/actions/nist-cavp/install.sh`.
- Modify (superproject): `.gitmodules`, `third_party/Jamfile` (the targets `wycheproof` and
  `nist-cavp`), `tools/ci/matrix.py` (`EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCIES['crypto']` gains `nist-cavp`, on
  every target, WebAssembly included, and `EXTERNAL_VARIABLES` `NIST_CAVP_ROOT`),
  `tools/ci/matrix_test.py`, `tools/ci/actions_test.py`, `.github/workflows/library.yml` (the
  step `nist-cavp`, on its name, in the lanes', own lanes' and tools' jobs).
- Create (library): `test/support/test_data.hpp`, `test/support/wycheproof_gcm.hpp`,
  `test/support/cavp_gcm.hpp`, `test/gcm_wycheproof_bearssl_test.cpp`,
  `test/gcm_cavp_bearssl_test.cpp`.
- Modify (library): `test/Jamfile`.

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `/third_party//wycheproof` (define `WEBCPP_TEST_WYCHEPROOF`, the checkout's
  absolute path with forward slashes, as a string literal; the directory under wasmtime);
  `/third_party//nist-cavp` (define `WEBCPP_TEST_NIST_CAVP`, the directory that holds
  `gcmtestvectors/` and `KAT_AES/`, likewise; webcpp's own tests left out with one line when
  it is absent, the build stopped under `webcpp-require-external=on`);
  `tools/ci/actions/nist-cavp/install.sh`, which lays the archives out in `.local/nist-cavp`;
  `std::string webcpp::test::read_file(std::string const& path)`;
  `template <class Backend> void webcpp::test::check_wycheproof_gcm()`;
  `template <class Backend> void webcpp::test::check_cavp_gcm()`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Pin NIST's archives** (O3), in `tools/ci/actions/nist-cavp/install.sh`, the
  OpenSSL action's form (its licence notice, `set -euo pipefail`, `helpers.sh`, a `refuse` that
  removes what it made):

```bash

# The step of tools/ci/actions/nist-cavp, and what a developer runs once: NIST CAVP's two
# archives of test vectors, gcmtestvectors.zip and KAT_AES.zip, downloaded from csrc.nist.gov,
# checked against the SHA-256 pinned here, and laid out in .local/nist-cavp as
# gcmtestvectors/ and KAT_AES/, where third_party/Jamfile's target nist-cavp reads them when
# NIST_CAVP_ROOT names no other directory. The archives are public-domain works of the US
# government; nothing of them is tracked. When NIST moves or changes them, download.sh fails
# naming the URL, and the pins move as a change of their own.

    printf 'NIST_CAVP_ROOT=%s\n' "${PWD}/.local/nist-cavp" >> "${GITHUB_ENV}"
fi
printf 'install.sh: NIST CAVP in .local/nist-cavp\n'
```

  `action.yml` is the OpenSSL action's with this script, its description the first paragraph
  above. On a CI runner the action is cached by `actions/cache` (pinned as library.yml pins it)
  under a key of the two SHA-256 digests, so that csrc.nist.gov is reached once per key, not
  per run. `tools/ci/actions_test.py` gains a case: with `download.sh` replaced by a fake that
  copies two fixture archives, the layout is made; with a wrong digest it refuses and leaves
  no `.local/nist-cavp`. Run it locally once: `bash tools/ci/actions/nist-cavp/install.sh`.
  Expected: `install.sh: NIST CAVP in .local/nist-cavp`.
- [ ] **Step 2: Add Wycheproof's submodule:**

```bash
git submodule add --depth 1 https://github.com/C2SP/wycheproof.git third_party/libs/wycheproof
git -C third_party/libs/wycheproof fetch --depth 1 origin 12fd3aaf33eb5fa1f52e026912ee00c054f9d984
git -C third_party/libs/wycheproof checkout 12fd3aaf33eb5fa1f52e026912ee00c054f9d984
git config -f .gitmodules submodule.third_party/libs/wycheproof.shallow true
```

  Check: `ls third_party/libs/wycheproof/testvectors_v1/aes_gcm_test.json .local/nist-cavp/gcmtestvectors/gcmDecrypt256.rsp`.
- [ ] **Step 3: Write the targets** in `third_party/Jamfile`, the JSON Schema Test Suite's
  form for Wycheproof, and the left-out rule of webcpp's own tests for NIST's archives, which
  the machine may lack:

```jam
# Wycheproof (Apache-2.0), C2SP/wycheproof: test data, never compiled. A test
# that names wycheproof reads it from the directory WEBCPP_TEST_WYCHEPROOF
# names, with forward slashes, the directory given to wasmtime on WASI.
path-constant WYCHEPROOF : libs/wycheproof ;
.wycheproof = [ regex.replace $(WYCHEPROOF) "\\\\" "/" ] ;

rule wycheproof-checked-out ( properties * )
{
    if ! [ path.exists $(WYCHEPROOF)/testvectors_v1/aes_gcm_test.json ]
    {
        errors.user-error "third_party/libs/wycheproof is not checked out: it holds no"
            "testvectors_v1/aes_gcm_test.json. Check it out with `git submodule update"
            "--init third_party/libs/wycheproof`." ;
    }
}

alias wycheproof : : <conditional>@wycheproof-checked-out : :
    <define>"\"WEBCPP_TEST_WYCHEPROOF=\\\"$(.wycheproof)\\\"\""
    [ webcpp.data $(WYCHEPROOF) ] ;
explicit wycheproof ;

# NIST's CAVP vectors (public domain), which webcpp does not track: the two
# archives tools/ci/actions/nist-cavp/install.sh downloads, checks against
# their pinned SHA-256 and lays out in .local/nist-cavp, or the directory
# -sNIST_CAVP_ROOT=<dir> names. Only webcpp's own tests read them, so a
# machine without them leaves those tests out with one line, and the CI, with
# webcpp-require-external=on, stops instead.
.nist-cavp-given = [ MATCH "^-sNIST_CAVP_ROOT=(.+)$" : [ modules.peek : ARGV ] ] ;
path-constant NIST_CAVP_LOCAL : ../.local/nist-cavp ;
.nist-cavp = $(.nist-cavp-given[-1]) ;
.nist-cavp ?= $(NIST_CAVP_LOCAL) ;
.nist-cavp-forward = [ regex.replace $(.nist-cavp) "\\\\" "/" ] ;

rule nist-cavp-found ( properties * )
{
    if [ path.exists $(.nist-cavp)/gcmtestvectors/gcmDecrypt128.rsp ]
    {
        return ;
    }
    local text = "NIST CAVP's archives are not in $(.nist-cavp): run `bash"
        "tools/ci/actions/nist-cavp/install.sh` from the superproject's root, or give"
        "-sNIST_CAVP_ROOT=<dir>, a directory that holds gcmtestvectors/ and KAT_AES/" ;
    if <webcpp-require-external>on in $(properties)
    {
        errors.user-error "/third_party//nist-cavp: $(text:J= )." ;
    }
    if ! $(.nist-cavp-told)
    {
        .nist-cavp-told = true ;
        ECHO "webcpp: crypto's tests of NIST's vectors are left out: $(text:J= )." ;
    }
    return <build>no ;
}

alias nist-cavp : : <conditional>@nist-cavp-found : :
    <define>"\"WEBCPP_TEST_NIST_CAVP=\\\"$(.nist-cavp-forward)\\\"\""
    [ webcpp.data $(.nist-cavp) ] ;
explicit nist-cavp ;
```

  The Jamfile's imports gain `modules`. A conditional of an alias that returns `<build>no`
  skips the tests that name it (M2's measurement of the same mechanism). A `.nist-cavp-told`
  variable of the module is b2's load-time state, as `webcpp.jam`'s `.left-out` is, not a
  library's. The tools test `tools/test/third_party_test.py` gains two cases: with
  `-sNIST_CAVP_ROOT=<an empty directory>` a test naming the target is skipped and the line is
  printed once; with `webcpp-require-external=on` the build stops with the text.

  The `.rsp` files have CRLF line ends, lower-case hex, and write an empty field with the
  space after `=` (`PT = `, 1,575 such lines in `gcmEncryptExtIV128.rsp`, measured with M3's
  files): the reader drops the `\r` and keeps what follows `" = "`, and `from_hex("")` is
  empty. `test/gcm_wycheproof_bearssl_test.cpp` and `test/gcm_cavp_bearssl_test.cpp` include
  `backends/bearssl.hpp` and their support header, and call the check for `bearssl`. In
  `test/Jamfile`:

```jam
# The vectors of spec section 8.1, read at run time from third_party/libs.
crypto-run gcm_wycheproof_bearssl : gcm_wycheproof_bearssl_test.cpp
  : <library>/third_party//bearssl <library>/third_party//wycheproof
    <library>/webcpp//boost_json ;
crypto-run gcm_cavp_bearssl : gcm_cavp_bearssl_test.cpp
  : <library>/third_party//bearssl <library>/third_party//nist-cavp ;
```

  Run the native lane. Expected: FAIL first on the missing support headers; once written,
  PASS. Then wasip2, wasip3 and emscripten. Expected: PASS on each (wasmtime given the two
  directories by `webcpp.data`; node reading them under `-sNODERAWFS=1`).
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit** (superproject)
  `"third_party: Wycheproof, and NIST CAVP's archives pinned by URL and SHA-256"` (after
  `git add -- tools/ci/actions/nist-cavp`); (library) `"crypto: AES-GCM against Wycheproof
  and NIST CAVP on BearSSL"`.

## Task 10: The user's Jamfiles as fixtures of a test of the tools, and webcpp's own programs marked

**Why this form** (owner item O4, the controller's ruling). The superproject already tests b2
projects that are not a library's ordinary tests: fixtures under `tools/test/fixtures/`, built
on a scratch copy of the superproject by a Python test of `tools/test/` (`harness.py`,
`emscripten_test.py`, `external_test.py`), which the CI's tools job runs. A user's Jamfile
(spec section 7, every build stop of section 8.6) is such a project: b2's raw `exe`, built as a
user builds it, its outcome checked. So this plan adds no kind of library directory and runs no
b2 inside b2: the cases are fixtures `tools/test/fixtures/crypto_jamfiles/<case>/` (a path the
lint's raw-rules pattern, `(libs|tools/test/fixtures)/[^/]+/(test|example)/`, does not match,
so a user's `exe` is allowed there, as it is not under a library's `test/`), and
`tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py` builds them.

**What the pattern cannot express, exactly.** The tools job runs on `ubuntu-24.04` alone
(`.github/workflows/library.yml`, job `tools`), so on the CI it builds the cases with Linux's
native toolset (GNU ld), wasip2, wasip3 and Emscripten (wasm-ld), and never with ld64 or
MSVC's `link.exe` and `cl`. Spec 8.6 asks for the canary's link messages "on ld64, wasm-ld,
Emscripten and MSVC", for MSVC's `C1189`, and for LNK2038. A developer's run on macOS covers
ld64 (recorded in the ledger), and nothing covers MSVC. The controller's ruling (O4'): the
tools job gains two legs, `macos-15` and `windows-2022`, that run
`tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py --target native` alone (the same test, the same fixtures)
at the nightly level, built in Task 25b. Until then, the outcomes' `[native-darwin]` blocks
run locally on macOS and the `[native-windows]` ones wait, which the ledger records.

**Files (superproject):**
- Create: `tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py`; the fixtures of the test itself,
  `tools/test/fixtures/crypto_jamfiles/hello/` (`Jamfile`, `hello.cpp`, `hello.outcome`) and
  `tools/test/fixtures/crypto_jamfiles/broken/` (`Jamfile`, `broken.cpp`, `broken.outcome`).
- Modify: `tools/webcpp.jam` (the feature `webcpp-own`; `program` sets it),
  `tools/test/webcpp_jam_test.py` (one case), `tools/test/harness.py` (`scratch_superproject`
  takes the paths a test leaves out of the copy) and `tools/test/harness_test.py` (its case),
  AGENTS.md (chapter 9: `webcpp-own`; the fixtures of `crypto_jamfiles` and their outcome
  files, under "Tests").

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: the feature `<webcpp-own>on`, which every program of `webcpp.run`, `run-fail`,
  `compile`, `compile-fail`, `compile-diagnostic`, `boost-test`, `example`, `headers-alone`,
  `link`, `serve` and `drive` carries; `harness.scratch_superproject(*fixtures, left_out=())`;
  `tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py` and its outcome files, which Tasks 11, 16, 18, 24, 29
  and 37 add cases to (a directory under `tools/test/fixtures/crypto_jamfiles/` each).

**The outcome file** (`<case>.outcome`, beside the case's Jamfile):

```
# A comment line starts with #. Blocks apply by the target and the system:
# [all], [native], [native-linux], [native-darwin], [native-windows],
# [wasip2], [wasip3], [emscripten]; [all] and every block that matches apply.
[all]
build: succeeds
run: app
aes256_gcm ok backend=bearssl
```

- `targets: <target> ...` (first line of `[all]`, optional): the targets the case is built
  for; without it, native only;
- `build: succeeds` or `build: fails` (b2's exit status);
- after `build: fails`, every other line of the applying blocks must appear, whole, in b2's
  output, in any order (a compiler's or linker's message, an `error:` of b2's);
- `run: <program>`, after `build: succeeds`: the program the build made is run as the lane
  runs one (natively itself, `wasmtime` for a `.wasm` of wasip2 or wasip3, the latter with
  `-W component-model-async=y -S p3=y`, `node` for emscripten's `.js`), and every other line
  of the applying blocks is its standard output, exactly, line for line;
- `no-dependency: <program> <library>` natively: `otool -L` on macOS, `ldd` on Linux,
  `dumpbin /DEPENDENTS` with MSVC must not name the library;
- `arguments: <word> ...`: words given to b2 for this case alone, each `@scratch` replaced by
  the case's scratch directory (a directory the test makes empty, for "not found" cases);
- `root: OPENSSL_ROOT` (or `BOTAN_ROOT`): the case gets `-s<variable>=<dir>` with the directory
  the test found for that library (below), placed last; no case gets a root it does not ask
  for (I5), and the test itself never receives a `-s` from the CI;
- `requires: static-libcrypto` (or `botan`): the case needs that on the machine; without it the
  test prints `crypto_jamfiles: <case> is left out: <why>` and goes on, and with the test's
  argument `--require-external` (which the CI's tools job passes) it fails instead (the left-out
  rule of webcpp's own tests, I6).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing cases.** In `tools/test/webcpp_jam_test.py`,
  `test_webcpp_programs_are_marked_own`: a fixture alias whose `<conditional>` rule writes,
  with `ECHO`, whether `<webcpp-own>on` is among its properties, named by a `webcpp.run`: the
  output holds `own: on`. In `tools/test/harness_test.py`,
  `test_a_scratch_copy_leaves_out_what_it_is_told`: `scratch_superproject(left_out=('third_party/libs/wycheproof',))`
  has no such directory and every other one. The fixtures of the test itself:
  `hello/Jamfile` is `exe hello : hello.cpp ;` (with the licence notice), `hello.cpp` prints
  `hello from a user's Jamfile`, `hello.outcome` is `[all]`, `targets: native wasip2`,
  `build: succeeds`, `run: hello`, `hello from a user's Jamfile`; `broken/Jamfile` is
  `exe broken : broken.cpp ;`, `broken.cpp` `#error "broken on purpose"`, and its outcome
  `build: fails`, `broken on purpose`. Run
  `python3 tools/test/webcpp_jam_test.py test_webcpp_programs_are_marked_own` and
  `python3 tools/test/harness_test.py test_a_scratch_copy_leaves_out_what_it_is_told`.
  Expected: FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 2: Mark webcpp's own programs.** In `tools/webcpp.jam`, beside the other
  features:

```jam
# webcpp-own=on: a program of webcpp's own tests and examples, which every
# rule of this file declares, so that a library webcpp does not build may
# leave it out when the machine lacks the library, while a user's program
# that names that library stops the build (AGENTS.md chapter 6, rule 7).
# Incidental, so that it plays no part in a build directory, and propagated,
# so that it reaches the library's alias.
feature.feature webcpp-own : on : optional incidental propagated ;
```

  and in `program`'s last line,
  `return <webcpp-targets>$(targets) <conditional>@webcpp%filter <webcpp-own>on ;`.
  `harness.scratch_superproject` gains `left_out: Sequence[str] = ()`, paths relative to the
  superproject removed from the copy's `ignore` (a directory named there is not copied). Run
  the two cases. Expected: PASS.
- [ ] **Step 3: Write `tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py`:**

"""Builds every fixture of tools/test/fixtures/crypto_jamfiles, a Jamfile as a user of
webcpp::crypto writes it (b2's raw exe), with b2 as a user runs it, and checks its outcome file:
the build's status, the lines a failure prints, a program's output, and the libraries a program
does not depend on (AGENTS.md chapter 9, "Tests"). One scratch superproject per target, with
libs/crypto and the fixtures in it and the test data's submodules left out; every case of a
target shares one build directory, so BearSSL's 295 files are compiled once per target. Run
with the names of some cases to run only those; --require-external makes a case whose library

  A target whose toolset the machine lacks (`clang-wasip2` not registered, no emsdk) stops
  the run with `harness`'s own message, never a silent skip. The CI's tools job runs every
  `tools/**/*_test.py` without arguments: its step gains `--require-external` for this test
  alone (the line that runs it is `python3 "$test" $( [ "$test" = tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py ] && echo --require-external )`,
  in the job's loop), and the job's setup gains the actions `openssl` and `nist-cavp`, so that
  `.local/openssl` holds the static library there.

  The cost (m20): the cases of a target run one after another, never two inner b2 at once,
  so each inner b2 keeps its default of every CPU and no outer `-j` multiplies it; and they
  share one build directory per target (`bin/user-<target>` in the scratch root), so
  BearSSL's 295 files and libsecp256k1's are compiled once per target, not once per case.
  The tools job runs every tools test in one 90-minute job; the test prints each target's
  time (`native: done in <s> s`), Task 25's green records the four in the ledger, and when
  their sum passes 30 minutes the test moves to a job of its own in `library.yml`, one
  matrix entry per target (`crypto_jamfiles_test.py --target <name>`, which `main` takes), and the tools job's loop leaves it out by name.
- [ ] **Step 4: Run** `python3 tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py hello broken`. Expected:
  `native: done in <s> s` and `wasip2: done in <s> s`, then `crypto_jamfiles_test: ok`. Change `hello.outcome`'s
  last line to `hello from elsewhere`: expected `crypto_jamfiles_test: failed` with the
  printed and the expected lines; put it back. Change `broken.outcome`'s message to `not this`:
  expected a fault naming the missing line; put it back.
- [ ] **Step 5: Run** `python3 tools/test/webcpp_jam_test.py`,
  `python3 tools/test/external_test.py`, `python3 tools/test/harness_test.py` and the lint.
  Expected: PASS and `lint: clean` (the fixtures' raw `exe` is outside the raw-rules pattern;
  `webcpp-own` is incidental and changes no build directory).
- [ ] **Step 6: Document** in AGENTS.md chapter 9: `webcpp-own` in "Libraries webcpp does not
  build", and under "Tests" the fixtures of `crypto_jamfiles` (a user's Jamfile per case,
  its outcome file's format, the test that builds them, and why they are fixtures of the
  tools' test and not a library's tests).
- [ ] **Step 7: Commit** (after `git add -- tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py tools/test/fixtures/crypto_jamfiles`):
  `"tools: the user's Jamfiles of webcpp::crypto as fixtures of a test of the tools, and
  webcpp's own programs carry webcpp-own"`.

## Task 11: OpenSSL, found or stopping, linked shared or static

**Files (superproject):**
- Modify: `tools/webcpp.jam` (`external-root`, `external-looked`; the knobs
  `-sWEBCPP_LOCAL=<dir>` and `-sWEBCPP_SYSTEM_INCLUDE=<dir>`), `tools/test/external_test.py`
  (cases), `third_party/Jamfile` (the feature and the target `openssl`),
  `tools/ci/actions/openssl/install.sh` (the static library), `tools/ci/actions_test.py`
  (its case), `tools/ci/matrix.py` and `tools/ci/matrix_test.py` (crypto's externals, a
  lane's list), `.github/workflows/library.yml` (each external action on its name),
  `AGENTS.md` (chapter 9: the knobs, the stop), `tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py` (the
  `make_root.py` hook, Step 4).
- Create (superproject): the fixtures `tools/test/fixtures/crypto_jamfiles/openssl_on_wasm/`,
  `openssl_not_found/`, `openssl_wrong_root/`, `openssl_static_missing/` (with its
  `make_root.py`), `openssl_shared/`, `openssl_static/`, each a `Jamfile`, an `app.cpp` and
  an outcome file.
- Modify (library): `build.jam` (the declaration, C13).

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `webcpp-own` (Task 10).
- Produces: `/third_party//openssl`, OpenSSL's libssl and libcrypto, one choice (I14); the
  feature `webcpp-crypto-openssl-link` (`shared`, `static`, propagated); `webcpp.external-root <owner> : <library> : <target>` (the
  directory, native form, or nothing); `webcpp.external-looked <owner> : <library> : <properties> *`
  (the "where it looked" text, or nothing when found); the matrix entry's `"externals"`, a
  list of the names of `tools/ci/actions/` a lane installs.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tools tests** in `tools/test/external_test.py`, on the
  scratch library `needs_ext` of the file:
  - `test_external_root_gives_the_directory`: a `build.jam` line
    `ECHO "root: [ webcpp.external-root needs_ext : libfake : native ]" ;` prints the `-s`
    directory, then the `.local/fake` one, then an empty root;
  - `test_external_looked_names_where`: the same with `external-looked` and
    `<toolset>clang`, printing the text `missing` returns, then nothing once `.local/fake`
    holds `fake.h`;
  - `test_the_local_and_system_knobs`: with `-sWEBCPP_LOCAL=<root>/other` and
    `-sWEBCPP_SYSTEM_INCLUDE=<root>/sys`, a `fake.h` in `<root>/sys` is found and one in
    `<root>/.local/fake` is not; the left-out message names `<root>/other/fake/include` and
    `<root>/sys`.
  Run `python3 tools/test/external_test.py`. Expected: FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 2: Write the rules** in `tools/webcpp.jam`. `local-root` reads
  `-sWEBCPP_LOCAL=<dir>` when given (a test's machine without the CI's installs), else
  `.local/`:

```jam
local rule local-root ( directory )
{
    local base = [ given WEBCPP_LOCAL ] ;
    base ?= [ path.join [ path.root $(.root) [ path.pwd ] ] .local ] ;
    return [ path.join $(base) $(directory) ] ;
}
```

  `missing` takes its system directories from `-sWEBCPP_SYSTEM_INCLUDE=<dir>` when given (one
  directory, on any system, written in the text as `nor does <dir>`), else
  `/usr/include /usr/local/include` natively outside Windows, as today (`nor does
  /usr/include or /usr/local/include`). Both knobs serve a test that must run as on a
  machine without the library; they read b2's command line, never the environment. Then:

```jam
# webcpp.external-root <owner> : <library> : <target> ; the directory
# webcpp.external returned for library, which a target of another project
# (third_party/Jamfile) links: the -s directory, else .local/<directory> when
# it holds the header, else nothing; nothing too when owner declared none.
rule external-root ( owner : library : target )
{
    local declared = $(.external.$(owner).$(library).$(target)) ;
    if ! $(declared)
    {
        return ;  # the owner's build.jam is not checked out: its caller says so (m8)
    }
    local root = [ given $(declared[1]) ] ;
    if $(root)
    {
        return [ path.native $(root) ] ;
    }
    root = [ local-root $(declared[2]) ] ;
    if [ path.exists [ path.native $(root)/include/$(declared[3]) ] ]
    {
        return [ path.native $(root) ] ;
    }
}

# webcpp.external-looked <owner> : <library> : <properties> * ; where it
# looked for library on the target of properties and did not find it, as the
# left-out message writes it, or nothing when it is there.
rule external-looked ( owner : library : properties * )
{
    local target = native ;
    if <toolset>emscripten in $(properties)
    {
        target = emscripten ;
    }
    local declared = $(.external.$(owner).$(library).$(target)) ;
    if $(declared)
    {
        return [ missing $(library) $(declared) : $(target) ] ;
    }
}
```

  and `external` returns `[ external-root $(owner) : $(library) : $(target) ]` after
  recording the declaration. Run the tools test. Expected: PASS, the existing cases too.
- [ ] **Step 3: Declare OpenSSL in crypto's `build.jam`** (C13), before the alias:

```jam
import webcpp ;

# OpenSSL, which webcpp does not build, is the backend /third_party//openssl
# links: found where -sOPENSSL_ROOT=<dir> says, else in .local/openssl, else,
# natively outside Windows, in /usr/include or /usr/local/include. Declared
# here, which the Jamroot loads at start, so that the index can say when the
# page is left out for want of it.
webcpp.external crypto : OpenSSL : OPENSSL_ROOT : openssl : openssl/evp.h : native ;
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Write the failing build cases**, each a fixture of Task 10's test,
  `tools/test/fixtures/crypto_jamfiles/<case>/`, a user's Jamfile with its licence notice, an
  `app.cpp` that makes a `gcm<aes256<backends::openssl>>` and prints `HAS_OPENSSL=1` when the
  define is set, and an outcome:

| Case | Its Jamfile | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openssl_on_wasm` | `exe app : app.cpp /webcpp/crypto//crypto /third_party//openssl ;` | `targets: wasip2 wasip3 emscripten`; `build: fails`; `error: /third_party//openssl: OpenSSL is a native backend, and this build is for WebAssembly. In the program's Jamfile, name /third_party//bearssl in its place.` |
| `openssl_not_found` | the same | `arguments: -sWEBCPP_LOCAL=@scratch -sWEBCPP_SYSTEM_INCLUDE=@scratch` (no root: the CI's `-sOPENSSL_ROOT` never reaches it, I5); `build: fails`; three lines, the parts of spec 4.4's fourth block around the directory, which varies: `error: /third_party//openssl: the program names OpenSSL, and it was not found: -sOPENSSL_ROOT=<dir> was not given, and `; `/openssl/include holds no openssl/evp.h, nor does `; `. Install it (apt install libssl-dev; brew install openssl@3, then give -sOPENSSL_ROOT=<the directory that brew --prefix openssl@3 prints>; or OpenSSL's Windows installer), give -sOPENSSL_ROOT=<dir>, the directory of its include/ and lib/, or name /third_party//bearssl in its place.` |
| `openssl_wrong_root` | the same | `arguments: -sOPENSSL_ROOT=@scratch`; `build: fails`; `holds no include/openssl/evp.h: give the directory of OpenSSL's include/ and lib/, or no -sOPENSSL_ROOT to look for OpenSSL in` |
| `openssl_static_missing` | `exe app : app.cpp /webcpp/crypto//crypto /third_party//openssl : <webcpp-crypto-openssl-link>static ;` | `arguments: -sOPENSSL_ROOT=@scratch/root`, a root the test makes with `include/openssl` linked from `.local/openssl` and an empty `lib/` (the outcome's line `arguments` cannot make it, so the case's directory holds `make_root.py`, which the test runs first when present, given the scratch directory); `build: fails`; `error: /third_party//openssl: <webcpp-crypto-openssl-link>static links ` and `, which does not exist: give -sOPENSSL_ROOT=<dir>, the directory of an OpenSSL whose lib/ holds it, or link OpenSSL shared.` |
| `openssl_shared` | `exe app : app.cpp /webcpp/crypto//crypto /third_party//openssl ;` | `root: OPENSSL_ROOT`; `build: succeeds`; `run: app`; `HAS_OPENSSL=1` |
| `openssl_static` | the same with `<webcpp-crypto-openssl-link>static` | `root: OPENSSL_ROOT`; `requires: static-libcrypto`; `build: succeeds`; `run: app`; `HAS_OPENSSL=1`; `no-dependency: app libcrypto`; `no-dependency: app libssl` |

  Task 10's test gains the hook its table names: a case directory holding `make_root.py` has it
  run as `python3 make_root.py <scratch>` before b2, with a case of its own in the test's
  self-check (`hello`'s directory gains none). Run
  `python3 tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py openssl_on_wasm openssl_shared`. Expected: FAIL,
  no target `openssl` in `/third_party`.
- [ ] **Step 5: Link the static libraries locally** (I6): the development machine's
  `.local/openssl/lib` holds the shared libraries alone (M7). Before any static program is
  declared, `ln -s /opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/lib/libcrypto.a /opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/lib/libssl.a .local/openssl/lib/`
  (on Linux the files `pkg-config --variable=libdir openssl` names), the change Step 8 makes
  the CI's action make, recorded in the ledger. Without them, webcpp's own static programs are
  left out with a line (Step 6), never a stop of the build.
- [ ] **Step 6: Write the target** in `third_party/Jamfile`: OpenSSL's libssl and libcrypto as
  one choice (I14), so that no program holds a static libcrypto beside a shared one, under one
  link feature:

```jam
# OpenSSL 3 (Apache-2.0), libssl and libcrypto together, which webcpp does not
# build: found where libs/crypto/build.jam declares it, natively only, linked
# shared (the default) or static (DESIGN, 2026-10-11 "webcpp::crypto's two
# departures accepted"). Both libraries follow the one feature, so that a
# process never holds two copies of libcrypto, a static one and a shared one
# under libssl, whose memory functions would be two (spec section 3.7;
# AGENTS.md chapter 6, rule 10). Propagated, so that a program's request
# reaches the library; not free, so that the two builds get directories of
# their own.
feature.feature webcpp-crypto-openssl-link : shared static : propagated ;

# What the static libraries are called under a root's lib/: OpenSSL's own
# build names them libcrypto.a and libssl.a; the Windows installer's, as the
# OpenSSL action copies them, libcrypto_static.lib and libssl_static.lib
# (measured in this task, C6).

}

# Nothing when OpenSSL is there for a native build. On WebAssembly the build
# stops, naming the backend to use. Natively, when OpenSSL or its static
# libraries are not found, webcpp's own programs are left out with one line
# (or the build stops under webcpp-require-external=on, as the CI builds),

```

  The message holds no `$(` of the shell's (b2 would expand it, AGENTS chapter 12).
  `webcpp.external-root` returns nothing, never an error, when its owner has declared nothing
  (a checkout without `libs/crypto`, review m8): `openssl-found`'s first check then names the
  checkout. A program that names `/third_party//openssl` gets libssl beside libcrypto; a shared
  libssl a program does not call adds its dependency at run time and no code (spec 4.2), which
  the documentation says. `tools/test/third_party_test.py` gains three cases: a static program
  of webcpp's own on a root without `libcrypto.a` is left out with the line and the build
  succeeds; with `webcpp-require-external=on` it stops; `/third_party//openssl` links
  `libssl` and `libcrypto` in that order (`-d+2`'s link line).
- [ ] **Step 7: The static libraries on the CI** (C6). In
  `tools/ci/actions/openssl/install.sh`, `link` also links `libcrypto.a` and `libssl.a` when
  `${libdir}` holds them (Ubuntu's `libssl-dev` and Homebrew's `openssl@3` do), and `windows`
  first prints `ls "${found}"` into the step's log, then copies `libcrypto_static.lib` and
  `libssl_static.lib` from `${found}` when they exist. The first CI run of this change on the
  Windows runners is the measurement:
  - the log lists both: the Jamfile's names stand;
  - it lists other static libraries (a `MT` directory's, or names of another form): the
    action copies those files under the Jamfile's names, their source named in the action's
    comment;
  - it lists none: the Windows static lane of OpenSSL cannot run on the image; the action
    copies nothing, webcpp's own static programs are left out there with Step 6's line (the
    CI's lanes give `webcpp-require-external=on`, so the Jamfiles of Tasks 15 and 16 declare
    their static twins `<build>no` on Windows through a conditional of their own, with the
    reason), and the owner is told (spec 8.5 asks for them on Windows).
  `tools/ci/actions_test.py` gains a case: on a fake Linux prefix holding `libcrypto.a` and
  `libssl.a`, the action links both.
- [ ] **Step 8: Crypto's externals on the CI, own lanes included** (I15).
  `tools/ci/matrix.py`:
  `EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCIES = {'trystero': ('secp256k1', 'libdatachannel', 'openssl'), 'crypto': ('openssl', 'nist-cavp')}`,
  `nist-cavp` marked as needed on every target (WebAssembly included: its files are test data),
  the others natively; a lane's entry gains `"externals"`, the sorted union of the actions its
  libraries need on its target (`[]` when none), beside the boolean `"external"`, which stays
  for the docs and lint jobs; and `own_lane_entry` gains the same `"externals"`, so that an
  own lane installs what its library needs, as a lane does. `.github/workflows/library.yml`:
  each external action's step is conditioned on its own name,
  `if: contains(matrix.externals, 'openssl') && !matrix.emsdk` (and `'secp256k1'`,
  `'libdatachannel'`, `'nist-cavp'` without the `!matrix.emsdk`), in the lanes' job and the
  own lanes' job alike, which share the anchors. `tools/ci/matrix_test.py` gains three cases:
  a plan for `--library crypto` lists `["nist-cavp", "openssl"]` on its native lanes and
  `["nist-cavp"]` on the WebAssembly ones; `own-lanes --library crypto` gives each entry the
  same `externals` as its target's lane; trystero's own lanes `oracle` and `interop` keep
  `["libdatachannel", "openssl", "secp256k1"]` natively. Run `python3 tools/ci/matrix_test.py`
  and `actionlint`. Expected: PASS.
- [ ] **Step 9: Run** `python3 tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py openssl_on_wasm openssl_not_found openssl_wrong_root openssl_static_missing openssl_shared openssl_static`.
  Expected: `crypto_jamfiles_test: ok` (the Linux run of the CI's tools job covers the same on
  GNU ld).
- [ ] **Step 10: Commit** (superproject, after `git add` of the new fixtures)
  `"tools: webcpp.external-root and external-looked; OpenSSL's libssl and libcrypto found or stopping, shared or static, in third_party"`,
  `"tools/ci: crypto needs OpenSSL and NIST's archives, and each lane and own lane installs only the external libraries its libraries name"`;
  (library) `"crypto: OpenSSL declared for its backend"`.

## Task 12: The OpenSSL backend: AES and AES-GCM, and OpenSSL's error queue

**Files:**
- Create: `include/webcpp/crypto/backends/openssl.hpp`, `test/support/aes_checks.hpp`,
  `test/gcm_openssl_test.cpp`, `test/gcm_limits_openssl_test.cpp`,
  `test/gcm_wycheproof_openssl_test.cpp`, `test/gcm_cavp_openssl_test.cpp`,
  `test/aes_openssl_test.cpp`, `test/openssl_error_queue_test.cpp`,
  `test/messages/openssl_not_linked/`, `test/messages/openssl_old/` (with
  `include/openssl/opensslv.h`).
- Modify: `test/Jamfile`, `test/messages/Jamfile`, `include/webcpp/crypto.hpp` (Task 14 adds
  the conditional includes; nothing here).

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 7's and Task 8's engine contracts; `/third_party//openssl`.
- Produces: `struct webcpp::crypto::backends::openssl { static constexpr std::string_view name = "openssl"; };`
  (Task 15 adds the install); the specialisations `gcm_state`, `gcm_engine`, `block_state`,
  `block_engine` for `backends::openssl` and key sizes 16, 24, 32;
  `boost::system::result<void> webcpp::crypto::detail::openssl_memory_guard() noexcept`
  (empty here; Task 15 fills it);
  `boost::system::result<EVP_CIPHER_CTX*> webcpp::crypto::detail::openssl_context(char const* cipher, std::span<std::uint8_t const> key, bool encrypting, bool padding) noexcept`;
  the checks of `test/support/aes_checks.hpp`: `check_fips197<Backend>()`,
  `check_aes_kat<Backend>()`, `check_aes_guards<Backend>()`, `check_aes_moved_from<Backend>()`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests.** `test/gcm_openssl_test.cpp` is
  `gcm_bearssl_test.cpp` with `backends/openssl.hpp` and `openssl` in place of BearSSL's, every
  check of Tasks 7 and 8 called; `gcm_limits_openssl_test.cpp`,
  `gcm_wycheproof_openssl_test.cpp` and `gcm_cavp_openssl_test.cpp` likewise. The block
  cipher's checks, `test/support/aes_checks.hpp`:

  `openssl_update` with an empty span makes no call, which keeps a null `data()` away from
  OpenSSL (Review Focus 3).
- [ ] **Step 3: Run** the native lane, then gcc-15's. Expected: PASS: every OpenSSL program
  and its twin; the two message tests. `gcm_wycheproof_openssl` and `gcm_cavp_openssl` agree
  with the vectors as BearSSL's did (226, 81, 6, 3; 1,125 per file and the FAIL counts), so
  the cap of 128 bytes and the zeroing hold on OpenSSL too. A difference here is a fault of
  the engine, never of the expected counts.
- [ ] **Step 4: Commit:** `"crypto: the OpenSSL backend: AES and AES-GCM on EVP, the error
  queue left as found"`.

## Task 13: BearSSL and OpenSSL agree

**Files:**
- Create: `test/support/agreement.hpp`, `test/agreement_gcm_test.cpp`,
  `test/agreement_gcm_portable_test.cpp`.
- Modify: `test/Jamfile`.

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `template <class A, class B> void webcpp::test::agree_gcm(std::uint64_t seed)`,
  which Task 35 extends to ChaCha20-Poly1305 and Task 39 to Botan.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test.** `test/support/agreement.hpp` (spec 8.2):

```cpp

// Two backends on the same inputs (spec section 8.2): random keys of 16, 24 and 32 bytes,
// IVs of 12 bytes and of random lengths from 1 to 64, additional data of 0 to 64 bytes,
// messages of 0 to 4,096 bytes and every size within 1 of a multiple of 16 up to 4,096,
// from a seeded generator whose seed a failure prints. What one seals the other opens, and
// the ciphertexts and tags are byte-identical.

  `test/agreement_gcm_test.cpp` includes both backends' headers and `support/agreement.hpp`,
  and calls `agree_gcm<bearssl, openssl>(20261011)` and, with the seed printed first,
  `agree_gcm<bearssl, openssl>(std::random_device{}())` (a test may use the standard library's
  device: the lint's world rule reads library headers only); `agreement_gcm_portable_test.cpp`
  is the same source with a different name. In `test/Jamfile`:

```jam
# BearSSL against OpenSSL (spec section 8.2), natively. The portable twin keeps
# BearSSL on aes_ct64 and ghash_ctmul64 through the backend's test seam, so
# that on x86-64 both of BearSSL's code paths are compared with OpenSSL's.
crypto-run agreement_gcm : agreement_gcm_test.cpp

  : <library>/third_party//bearssl <library>/third_party//openssl
    <define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DETAIL_BEARSSL_PORTABLE : native ;
```

  The two programs have sources of their own, so b2 compiles each with its own defines (spec
  4.3's pitfall). Run the native lane. Expected: FAIL first on the missing header; then PASS.
- [ ] **Step 2: Prove that the seam selects what it says.** On the CI's x86-64 runner (the
  gcc-14 and clang-18 lanes), the first program's BearSSL runs AES-NI and PCLMUL and the twin
  `aes_ct64` and `ghash_ctmul64`: a check in each program, natively on x86-64 only
  (`#if defined(__x86_64__) || defined(_M_X64)`), compares
  `webcpp::crypto::detail::bearssl_ctr()` with `br_aes_x86ni_ctr_get_vtable()` (expected
  equal in the first unless the CPU lacks AES-NI, which the check then prints) and with
  `&br_aes_ct64_ctr_vtable` (expected equal in the twin).
- [ ] **Step 3: Commit:** `"crypto: BearSSL and OpenSSL agree on AES-GCM, both of BearSSL's
  code paths"`.

## Task 14: The default backend, the convenience headers, and their net on MSVC

**Files:**
- Create: `include/webcpp/crypto/aes256_gcm.hpp`, `test/default_both_test.cpp`,
  `test/default_selected_test.cpp`, `test/default_bearssl_test.cpp`.
- Modify: `include/webcpp/crypto.hpp`, `test/Jamfile`.

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `webcpp::crypto::aes128_gcm`, `webcpp::crypto::aes256_gcm`; the MSVC key
  `webcpp_crypto_default_backend` (Review Focus 4).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests.** `test/default_both_test.cpp`:

    BOOST_TEST_EQ(webcpp::crypto::aes256<>::backend_type::name, "openssl");
    return webcpp::test::exit_status(boost::report_errors());
}
```

  `default_selected_test.cpp` expects `"bearssl"` with both linked and
  `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_BEARSSL` defined; `default_bearssl_test.cpp` expects
  `"bearssl"` with BearSSL alone, on every target. In `test/Jamfile`:

```jam

  Run the native lane. Expected: FAIL, `aes256_gcm.hpp` not found.

## Task 15: OpenSSL's memory functions, an option of the config: the adapter and the install

**Files:**
- Modify: `include/webcpp/crypto/backends/openssl.hpp`.
- Create: `test/openssl_memory/Jamfile`, `test/openssl_memory/adapter_test.cpp`.
- Modify: `test/Jamfile` (`build-project openssl_memory ;`).

**Interfaces:**
- Produces, under `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_OPENSSL_MEMORY_RESOURCE` (spec 3.7):
  `std::pmr::memory_resource& webcpp::crypto::openssl_memory_resource() noexcept;` (declared;
  the program defines it);

- [ ] **Step 3: Run** the native lane and gcc-15's. Expected: PASS, `adapter` and its three
  twins. Then `$B2 -a --build-dir=bin/lane-native libs/crypto/test` whole: every earlier
  OpenSSL test still passes, without the option.
- [ ] **Step 4: Commit:** `"crypto: OpenSSL's memory functions as an option of the config:
  the adapter, the install, and make's guard"`.

## Task 16: The memory option, process by process

**Files:**
- Create, in `test/openssl_memory/`: `support.hpp` (the counting resource that is never
  destroyed, the exit check, the counter of the C library's allocator), `interpose_darwin.c`,
  `interpose_linux.cpp`, `everything_test.cpp`, `off_reported_test.cpp`, `late_test.cpp`,
  `foreign_test.cpp`, `fresh_install_test.cpp`, `forgotten_test.cpp`, `replaced_test.cpp`,
  `second_install_test.cpp`, `fail_second_test.cpp`, `fail_init_test.cpp`.
- Create (superproject), fixtures of Task 10's test: `tools/test/fixtures/crypto_jamfiles/memory_missing_definition_install/`
  and `memory_missing_definition_make/` (a Jamfile, an `app.cpp` and an `.outcome` each), and
  `memory_two_files/` (`Jamfile`, `main.cpp`, `with.cpp`, `.outcome`).
- Modify: `test/openssl_memory/Jamfile`.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 15.
- Produces: `webcpp::test::counting_resource` (in `support.hpp`):
  `std::size_t allocations() const`, `std::size_t live() const`, `void arm(std::size_t after)`
  (the allocation after `after` more fails, as Task 15's resource fails), `bool foreign_free() const`;
  `webcpp::test::the_counting_resource()`; `void webcpp::test::main_returns() noexcept`;
  `extern "C" std::size_t webcpp_test_c_allocations(void)` and
  `void webcpp_test_count_c_allocations(int on)` (the interposers').

- [ ] **Step 1: Write `support.hpp`:**

// upstream is null_memory_resource(), so that the resource itself never calls the C
// library; its table of the blocks it gave, which finds a free of another's block; and the
// exit check: main returns 3, and when OpenSSL's cleanup has given every block back after
// main, the resource writes its line and ends the process with 0. Its destructor, which
// must never run, writes a line and ends it with 4 (C7).

```

- [ ] **Step 4: Write the other programs**, each `main` a few lines over `support.hpp`:
  - `off_reported_test.cpp`, in a sibling directory, `test/openssl_memory_off/`, with a
    Jamfile of its own (`project : requirements <library>/webcpp/crypto//crypto <library>/third_party//openssl ;`,
    `webcpp.targets native ;`, `webcpp.run off_reported : off_reported_test.cpp ;` and its
    twins) named by `build-project openssl_memory_off ;` in `test/Jamfile`: a subdirectory of
    `test/openssl_memory/` would inherit that project's requirement
    `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_OPENSSL_MEMORY_RESOURCE` (I7). It installs test functions with
    `CRYPTO_set_mem_functions` that count, as CR-PROBES `ossl_open.c` does, makes, seals and
    opens, and prints `make allocated <n> blocks, seal 0, open 0`; it passes when seal and
    open counted 0 and prints the make's count, which the documentation quotes (spec 8.5,
    "Off, reported");
  - `late_test.cpp`: `EVP_CIPHER_free(EVP_CIPHER_fetch(nullptr, "AES-256-GCM", nullptr))`,
    then `install_memory_functions()` must give `memory_functions_refused` with spec 3.7's
    message (`.error().message()` compared), and `detail::openssl_defaults_installed()` is
    still true; `main` returns `boost::report_errors()` (the resource never received a
    block, so the exit check does not apply: `main_returned` is not called);
  - `foreign_test.cpp`: `CRYPTO_set_mem_functions` with three counting functions of the
    test's, `OPENSSL_free(OPENSSL_malloc(1))` through them, then `install_memory_functions()`
    gives `memory_functions_refused`, and `CRYPTO_get_mem_functions` still gives the test's;
  - `fresh_install_test.cpp`: `install_memory_functions()` succeeds in a program that has not
    used OpenSSL; this is the program that proves, on MSVC's shared link, that OpenSSL's
    defaults are recognised through the import (spec 8.5);
  - `forgotten_test.cpp`: without the install, `gcm<aes256<openssl>>::make` gives
    `memory_functions_not_installed` with spec 3.7's message, and then
    `CRYPTO_set_mem_functions(<the adapter>)` returns 1: OpenSSL has allocated nothing, so
    the mark came after the guard (spec 8.5's last item of "A failing resource"); the program
    then makes and seals once, and ends through the exit check;
  - `replaced_test.cpp`: install, make; a second party's functions installed with
    `CRYPTO_set_mem_functions` (it returns 1, as OpenSSL accepts it, PROBE-R3 mode `on`);
    the next `make` gives `memory_functions_not_installed`; the adapter is put back with
    `CRYPTO_set_mem_functions` before `main` returns, and the exit check holds;
  - `second_install_test.cpp`: two installs succeed, and `openssl_adapter_installed()`;
  - `fail_second_test.cpp`: install, a good make; then `arm(0)`: the next make's first
    allocation fails and gives `errc::not_enough_memory`; a make after it succeeds; `arm(1)`:
    the second allocation fails and gives `backend_failure`; before each make the test
    raises `ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_USER, ERR_R_PASSED_INVALID_ARGUMENT)` and after it the queue
    holds that one entry (Task 12's `drain`);
  - `fail_init_test.cpp`: install, `arm(0)`, then make gives `backend_failure`; the resource
    no longer fails, and a second make gives `backend_failure` again (the permanence of
    spec 3.7); the queue holds the test's entry alone after each.
  In `test/openssl_memory/Jamfile`, after `memory-run adapter`:

```jam
# The C library's allocator, counted: an interposer linked at launch on macOS
# (C5), the program's own malloc on Linux, nothing on Windows.
lib interpose_darwin : interpose_darwin.c : <link>shared <warnings>off ;
explicit interpose_darwin ;
.counter = <target-os>darwin:<library>interpose_darwin
    <target-os>linux:<source>interpose_linux.cpp
    <target-os>windows:<source>interpose_windows.cpp ;

memory-run everything : everything_test.cpp : $(.counter) ;
memory-run late : late_test.cpp : $(.counter) ;
memory-run foreign : foreign_test.cpp : $(.counter) ;
memory-run fresh_install : fresh_install_test.cpp : $(.counter) ;
memory-run forgotten : forgotten_test.cpp : $(.counter) ;
memory-run replaced : replaced_test.cpp : $(.counter) ;
memory-run second_install : second_install_test.cpp : $(.counter) ;
memory-run fail_second : fail_second_test.cpp : $(.counter) ;
memory-run fail_init : fail_init_test.cpp : $(.counter) ;
```

  `lib` is not one of the raw rules the lint refuses (AGENTS chapter 6). The static twins on
  Windows depend on Task 11's measurement: if the image has no static libcrypto, the
  `_static` programs are declared `<target-os>linux` and `<target-os>darwin` only, through
  a conditional of the Jamfile's own that returns `<build>no` on Windows, with the reason.
- [ ] **Step 5: Write the link cases** (spec 8.6, crypto-r3-review I2), fixtures of Task 10's
  test under `tools/test/fixtures/crypto_jamfiles/`, each with `root: OPENSSL_ROOT`:
  - `memory_missing_definition_install/`: `project app : requirements <define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_OPENSSL_MEMORY_RESOURCE <library>/third_party//openssl ;`
    and `exe app : app.cpp /webcpp/crypto//crypto ;`, whose `app.cpp` calls
    `install_memory_functions()` and defines no resource;
  - `memory_missing_definition_make/`: the same, `app.cpp` making a `gcm<aes256<openssl>>`;
  - their outcome, on native: `build: fails` and `webcpp::crypto::openssl_memory_resource()`,
    and per linker, measured by this step's first run and then written into the outcome:
    `[native-darwin]` `Undefined symbols for architecture` (ld64, PROBE-R3 `linkerr.log`),
    `[native-linux]` the GNU ld or lld line that names it (gcc's lanes link with GNU ld,
    clang's with the system's), `[native-windows]` `LNK2019` and `LNK1120`;
  - `memory_two_files/`: `obj with : with.cpp /webcpp/crypto//crypto /third_party//openssl : <define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_OPENSSL_MEMORY_RESOURCE ;`
    and `exe app : main.cpp with /webcpp/crypto//crypto /third_party//openssl ;`, `with.cpp`
    defining the resource and a function that makes a `gcm` under the option, `main.cpp`
    making one without; outcome `[native-windows]` `build: fails`,
    `LNK2038: mismatch detected for 'webcpp_crypto_openssl_memory'`; `[native-linux]` and
    `[native-darwin]` `build: succeeds`, which records that only MSVC's linker catches it
    (the documentation says so).
  Each is native only (no `targets:` line). These Jamfiles are also the first b2
  build of spec 7.3's project-requirements form (crypto-r3-review's unmeasured fact): if b2
  refuses `<library>` in a project's requirements, or the define does not reach a target,
  the form is replaced in spec 7.3's text and the documentation by an alias the program's
  targets name, `alias openssl-memory : : : : <define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_OPENSSL_MEMORY_RESOURCE <library>/third_party//openssl ;`,
  measured the same way, and the owner is told.
- [ ] **Step 6: Run** the native lane (Apple clang), gcc-15's, and
  `python3 tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py memory_missing_definition_install memory_missing_definition_make memory_two_files`.
  Expected: PASS, every program of `test/openssl_memory` and `test/openssl_memory_off` and
  their twins, and the link cases. On the CI's MSVC lanes the Windows branch of the identity check, the
  `_onexit` order and the LNK messages are measured for the first time (spec 3.7, 8.5):
  - `fresh_install` fails on the shared link: the identity check is wrong. The test prints
    `f`, `GetProcAddress`'s answer and `&CRYPTO_malloc`; the task stops and the owner
    chooses between comparing with the import table's `__imp_CRYPTO_malloc` and refusing the
    option on MSVC's shared link;
  - `everything` exits 3 on the shared link: `OPENSSL_cleanup` did not give every block back
    before the process ended (the DLL's `_onexit` handler did not run, or not to the end);
    a hang (`TerminateProcess` not ending the process inside `DLL_PROCESS_DETACH`, m18) is
    the other outcome the first MSVC run measures: if it hangs, the Windows twins run through
    `webcpp.drive` with `<webcpp-drive-timeout>60`, whose keeper kills the process and fails
    the test, so that no CI job waits for its own timeout.
    The resource's line is then absent; the test is changed on that lane alone to pass when
    neither the destructor's line appears nor a foreign free, and to print the live count,
    and spec 3.7's statement and the documentation say what was measured;
  - the LNK lines are written into the outcomes as measured.
- [ ] **Step 7: Commit:** `"crypto: the memory option proved process by process: every
  allocation in the resource, the late, foreign and forgotten installs, a failing resource,
  the exit"`.

## Task 17: Allocation on every backend, and BearSSL's seeder

**Files:**
- Create: `test/support/counting.hpp`, `test/counting_test.cpp`,
  `test/allocation_bearssl_test.cpp`, `test/allocation_openssl_test.cpp`,
  `test/bearssl_seeder_test.cpp`.
- Modify: `test/Jamfile`.

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `test/support/counting.hpp`: `webcpp::test::allocations()` (every `operator new`
  form and the C library's allocator where a program can count it, I3),
  `webcpp::test::c_allocations_counted`, used by Tasks 27, 29, 35 and 38.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests.** One counting support for every allocation test
  of the plan (I3), which sees both `operator new` and the C library's allocator, as trystero's
  `allocation_test.cpp` and asio's tests do: `test/support/counting.hpp`, included by one
  source per program:

//
// Distributed under the Boost Software License, Version 1.0. (See
// accompanying file LICENSE_1_0.txt or copy at
// https://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt)

// Counts every allocation of the program that includes this header once (spec section 8.5):
// every form of the global operator new, and the C library's malloc, calloc, realloc,
// aligned_alloc and posix_memalign, where a program can see them: glibc's replaced and
// forwarded to its __libc_* functions, Emscripten's replaced and forwarded to its
// emscripten_builtin_* (its dlmalloc defines them weak), macOS's through malloc_logger, the
// hook libsystem_malloc calls on every allocation. WASI's wasi-libc defines malloc and its
// __libc_malloc in one object (dlmalloc.c.obj, measured with nm), so a program cannot
// replace one and keep the other, and MSVC's C runtime has no hook: there the C library's
// allocations are not counted, and c_allocations_counted says so, which the tests print.
// A block of operator new is counted twice where the C library is counted (once by new, once
// by the malloc it calls): every test compares a count before and after a window, so this
// changes no verdict. Nothing here reads a thread_local: on macOS the first read of one on a
// thread allocates through dyld (_tlv_get_addr), inside malloc_logger, which recursed until
// the stack ended (N1, measured in the review's rr1/logger.cpp).

  (`BOOST_TEST`'s own reporting is outside the counted window: the window holds the calls

  `test/allocation_openssl_test.cpp`: before anything, `CRYPTO_set_mem_functions` with three
  counting functions of the test's (OpenSSL's allocations, outside the user's allocator by
  the accepted departure); then `make` of `gcm<aes256<openssl>>` and of `aes256<openssl>`,
  whose counts it prints (`make: <n> allocations through OpenSSL's functions, first make
  included` and `second make: <m>`) and does not refuse; then seal, open (good and failed),
  the incremental seal, encrypt and decrypt, each with OpenSSL's count and
  `webcpp::test::allocations()` unchanged, the C library's allocator included where counted
  (spec 8.5: 0 on 3.6.4, PROBE-1011; 3.0.13, the CI's Linux, measured by this test). OpenSSL's
  test functions forward to the C library's own (`__libc_malloc` on glibc), so that what

  `test/counting_test.cpp`, the counter itself (N1): it counts each allocation exactly as
  documented and allocates nothing of its own, re-entrantly or not, on the first thread and on
  a new one (where a `thread_local` read would have allocated through dyld on macOS):

  In `test/Jamfile`:

```jam
crypto-run counting : counting_test.cpp ;
crypto-run allocation_bearssl : allocation_bearssl_test.cpp : <library>/third_party//bearssl ;
crypto-run allocation_openssl : allocation_openssl_test.cpp : <library>/third_party//openssl
  : native ;
crypto-run bearssl_seeder : bearssl_seeder_test.cpp : <library>/third_party//bearssl ;
```

  Run the four lanes, and on macOS (Apple clang, the native lane) `counting` and
  `allocation_bearssl` by name first (`$B2 -a libs/crypto/test//counting libs/crypto/test//allocation_bearssl`):
  macOS is the one target where a counter that allocates inside `malloc_logger` crashes before
  `main` (N1). Expected: FAIL first on the missing header, then PASS on every target, `counting`
  with 1,000 of 1,000 at each size on both threads; the OpenSSL counts are printed in the test's
  output, which Task 24's page quotes.
- [ ] **Step 2: Commit:** `"crypto: no allocation in a message on BearSSL or OpenSSL, and
  BearSSL's seeder getentropy alone"`.

## Task 18: Every message at link time and on MSVC, and the canary's pins

**Files:**
- Create, fixtures of Task 10's test under `tools/test/fixtures/crypto_jamfiles/`:
  `canary_missing/`, `canary_other_commit/`,
  `canary_other_configuration/`, `canary_without/`, `canary_two_files/`,
  `default_two_files/`, `left_out/`, and `msvc_<case>/` for each `#error` and
  `static_assert` case of Tasks 6, 7 and 12 (`msvc_no_backend`, `msvc_bearssl_not_linked`,
  `msvc_openssl_not_linked`, `msvc_two_defaults`, `msvc_memory_option_without_openssl`,
  `msvc_aes_on_bearssl`), each a `Jamfile`, an `app.cpp` (and a second source where named)
  and an `.outcome`.
- Modify (superproject): `tools/lint/lint.sh` (the rule `canary pins`), `tools/lint/lint_test.py`.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py` and its outcome files (Task 10), the canary
  seams (Task 5, Task 6). The fixtures are copied to `<scratch>/user/<case>/`, so a path into
  the superproject is `../../<path>`.

The cases' `[native-darwin]` blocks run on the developer's macOS, and their `[native-windows]`
blocks on the tools job's nightly Windows leg once Task 25b has built it (Task 10's
preamble, O4'); until then the ledger records them as not yet run.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the canary cases** (spec 4.3 layer 2, 8.6). Every case's `app.cpp` makes
  a `gcm<aes256<backends::bearssl>>` and seals once. The Jamfiles:
  - `canary_missing`: `exe app : app.cpp /webcpp/crypto//crypto : <define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_HAS_BEARSSL=1 <include>../../third_party/libs/bearssl/inc ;`
    (the header found, the library not linked);
  - `canary_other_commit`: `exe app : app.cpp /webcpp/crypto//crypto /third_party//bearssl : <define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_BEARSSL_CANARY_COMMIT=0000000 ;`;
  - `canary_other_configuration`: the same with
    `<define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_BEARSSL_CANARY_CONFIGURATION=sysrng`;
  - `canary_without`: a library of BearSSL's sources without the canary,

```jam

#
# Distributed under the Boost Software License, Version 1.0. (See
# accompanying file LICENSE_1_0.txt or copy at
# https://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt)

# BearSSL built by other means, without webcpp's canary: the program links every
# BearSSL function it calls, and only the canary is missing.
path-constant BEARSSL : ../../third_party/libs/bearssl ;
lib bearssl-plain : [ glob $(BEARSSL)/src/*.c $(BEARSSL)/src/*/*.c ]

  : : <include>$(BEARSSL)/inc <define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_HAS_BEARSSL=1 ;
exe app : app.cpp bearssl-plain /webcpp/crypto//crypto ;
```

  The outcomes, `targets: native wasip2 wasip3 emscripten` and `build: fails` in `[all]` and
  the canary's name, which every linker prints, then each linker's own line (spec 4.3's
  table):

```

  for `canary_missing` and `canary_without`; `canary_other_commit`'s name has `0000000` in
  place of `7bea48e`, `canary_other_configuration`'s `sysrng` in place of `getentropy` and
  `noseeder`. The GNU ld line on Linux (`undefined reference to `...'`) is measured by the
  first run on the gcc and clang lanes and written into `[native-linux]` as measured.
  Through a static library a mismatching canary member is not loaded, so another commit
  gives LNK2001 on MSVC, not LNK2038 (spec 4.3).
- [ ] **Step 2: Write the cases of LNK2038** (layer 3; Review Focus 4):
  - `canary_two_files`: `obj other : other.cpp /webcpp/crypto//crypto /third_party//bearssl : <define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_BEARSSL_CANARY_CONFIGURATION=getentropy ;`
    and `exe app : app.cpp other /webcpp/crypto//crypto /third_party//bearssl ;`; outcome
    `[native-windows]` `build: fails`,
    `LNK2038: mismatch detected for 'webcpp_crypto_backend_bearssl'`,
    `fatal error LNK1319`; elsewhere `build: succeeds`, since `getentropy` is those targets'
    own configuration and both files read the one canary the library defines;
  - `default_two_files`: `obj with : with.cpp /webcpp/crypto//crypto /third_party//bearssl /third_party//openssl : <define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_BEARSSL ;`
    and `exe app : main.cpp with /webcpp/crypto//crypto /third_party//bearssl /third_party//openssl ;`,
    each source naming `aes256_gcm`; native only; `[native-windows]` `build: fails` and
    `LNK2038: mismatch detected for 'webcpp_crypto_default_backend'`; `[native-linux]` and
    `[native-darwin]` `build: succeeds`.
- [ ] **Step 3: Write the MSVC cases of the `#error`s and `static_assert`s** (C14): each
  `msvc_<case>` directory is the compile-diagnostic case of the same name as a user's
  program (`exe app : app.cpp /webcpp/crypto//crypto <its requirements> ;`), native, with the
  outcome `[native]` `build: fails` and the message's text up to its
  first `(`, which every compiler prints whole, and `[native-windows]` `fatal error C1189`
  (for an `#error`) or `error C2338` (for a `static_assert`; the code MSVC 14.3 and 14.5
  print is the first run's measurement, written as measured).
- [ ] **Step 4: Write the case of webcpp's own program left out** (spec 4.4, the measured
  message): `left_out/Jamfile` is a test Jamfile of webcpp's form, `import webcpp ;` and
  `webcpp.run uses : app.cpp : <library>/webcpp/crypto//crypto <library>/third_party//openssl ;`,
  and its outcome gives `arguments: -sWEBCPP_LOCAL=@scratch -sWEBCPP_SYSTEM_INCLUDE=@scratch`,
  `build: succeeds` and
  `webcpp: crypto is left out: OpenSSL was not found: -sOPENSSL_ROOT=<dir> was not given, and `.
- [ ] **Step 5: Run** `python3 tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py` (every case: the canary
  cases on the four targets, the rest natively). Expected: `crypto_jamfiles_test: ok`; the GNU
  ld lines of `[native-linux]` are written from the first Linux run (the CI's tools job, or a
  Linux machine), as measured.
- [ ] **Step 6: Write the lint rule `canary pins`** (spec 8.6's last paragraph, AGENTS rule
  11). Its failing case in `tools/lint/lint_test.py`: a scratch tree whose
  `libs/crypto/include/webcpp/crypto/detail/canary.h` pins `#define WEBCPP_CRYPTO_BEARSSL_COMMIT 1234567`
  while `third_party/libs/bearssl` is a repository at another commit must fail with
  `canary pins: libs/crypto/include/webcpp/crypto/detail/canary.h: bearssl is pinned at 1234567 and third_party/libs/bearssl is at <short head>`.
  Then the rule:

```bash
# 15. Each canary's commit is its submodule's (AGENTS.md chapter 6, rule 11):
#    every `#define WEBCPP_CRYPTO_<NAME>_COMMIT <hex>` of crypto's detail/canary.h names
#    the first seven digits of third_party/libs/<name>'s HEAD.
rule 'canary pins'
pins="$(grep -hoE '^#define WEBCPP_CRYPTO_[A-Z0-9]+_COMMIT [0-9a-f]{7}$' \
    libs/crypto/include/webcpp/crypto/detail/canary.h 2>/dev/null || true)"
pin_faults=''
while read -r _ macro hex; do
    [ -n "${macro}" ] || continue
    name="$(printf '%s' "${macro}" | sed -E 's/^WEBCPP_CRYPTO_(.*)_COMMIT$/\1/' | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z')"
    head="$(git -C "third_party/libs/${name}" rev-parse --short=7 HEAD 2>/dev/null || printf 'missing')"
    if [ "${head}" != "${hex}" ]; then
        pin_faults="${pin_faults}libs/crypto/include/webcpp/crypto/detail/canary.h: ${name} is pinned at ${hex} and third_party/libs/${name} is at ${head}
"
    fi
done <<EOF_PINS
${pins}
EOF_PINS
if [ -n "${pin_faults}" ]; then
    printf '%s' "${pin_faults}"
    fail "a canary's commit is not its submodule's"
else
    printf "every canary's commit is its submodule's\n"
fi
```

  The rule's number follows the last of `lint.sh`. The canary pins are written
  `#define WEBCPP_CRYPTO_BEARSSL_COMMIT 7bea48e` on one line each, inside their `#ifdef`'s
  `#else` (Task 5's form), which the pattern matches. Run `python3 tools/lint/lint_test.py`
  and the lint. Expected: PASS and `lint: clean`.
- [ ] **Step 7: Commit** (superproject, after `git add` of the new fixtures)
  `"tools: every link-time and MSVC message of webcpp::crypto from a fixture of its own, as a
  user meets it"` and `"tools: the lint checks each canary's commit against its submodule"`.

## Task 19: `<windows.h>` before and after every header, on MSVC

**Files:**
- Create: `test/windows_h_before_test.cpp`, `test/windows_h_after_test.cpp`.
- Modify: `test/Jamfile`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the tests** (spec 2.2, 8.6). `windows_h_before_test.cpp`:

```cpp
// Copyright (c) 2026 WebCpp.org
//
// Distributed under the Boost Software License, Version 1.0. (See
// accompanying file LICENSE_1_0.txt or copy at
// https://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt)

// A bare <windows.h> (no NOMINMAX, no WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN) before every public header,
// with the memory option on so that backends/openssl.hpp's Windows branch compiles, and
// max used as a function after them. Elsewhere than Windows the program is the headers
// and the uses alone.

#ifdef _WIN32
#include <windows.h>
#endif

#include <webcpp/crypto.hpp>
#include <webcpp/crypto/backends/openssl.hpp>

#include <algorithm>
#include <limits>
#include <memory_resource>

std::pmr::memory_resource& webcpp::crypto::openssl_memory_resource() noexcept {
    return *std::pmr::new_delete_resource();
}

int main() {
    int const larger = (std::max)(1, 2);
    auto const largest = (webcpp::crypto::random_device::max)();  // lint-world: a test
    return larger == 2 && largest == (std::numeric_limits<unsigned int>::max)() ? 0 : 1;
}
```

  The test calls `max` in parentheses because a bare `<windows.h>` included first defines
  the macros for the whole program, which is what its author asked for; the headers' own
  `(max)()` is what is under test. `windows_h_after_test.cpp` includes the webcpp headers
  first and a bare `<windows.h>` after them, which its include guard makes add nothing
  (spec 2.2), and calls `std::max(1, 2)` and `webcpp::crypto::random_device::max()` without
  parentheses: they compile because webcpp's include defined `NOMINMAX` for its own
  `<windows.h>` and undefined it after.
  In `test/Jamfile`:

```jam
# <windows.h> before and after every header (spec section 2.2), on MSVC with
# the memory option's Windows branch; elsewhere the headers alone.
crypto-run windows_h_before : windows_h_before_test.cpp
  : <library>/third_party//bearssl <library>/third_party//openssl
    <define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_OPENSSL_MEMORY_RESOURCE : native ;
crypto-run windows_h_after : windows_h_after_test.cpp
  : <library>/third_party//bearssl <library>/third_party//openssl
    <define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_OPENSSL_MEMORY_RESOURCE : native ;
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run** natively. Expected: PASS here; on the CI's MSVC 14.3 and 14.5 lanes the
  same, which is the test (`winsock.h` not dragged in, `max` not broken).
- [ ] **Step 3: Commit:** `"crypto: every header compiles beside a bare <windows.h>, before
  and after"`.

## Task 20: Constant time

**Files:**
- Create: `test/constant_time/Jamfile`, `ctgrind_test.cpp`, `msan_test.cpp`, `dudect.hpp`,
  `dudect_test.cpp`, `valgrind.mjs`, `msan_report.mjs`, `openssl.supp`, `package.json`,
  `package-lock.json`.
- Modify: `test/Jamfile`
  (`build-project constant_time ;`); (superproject) `tools/ci/matrix.py` (an own lane's
  `apt` packages), `tools/ci/matrix_test.py`, `.github/workflows/library.yml` (the own lanes'
  job installs them).

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: the own lane `constant-time` (native: Valgrind and MemorySanitizer on Linux;
  dudect natively and on wasip2), which `runners.yml` also runs on `ubuntu-24.04-arm`
  (Task 22).

- [ ] **Step 0: The declassification seam** (I8). A constant-time checker reports a branch on
  any value derived from a marked secret, and an `open` branches on whether the tag matched,
  which is public by design but derived from the key and the tag. BoringSSL's
  `constant_time_declassify` is the precedent: the library marks the verdict public where it
  first branches on it. `include/webcpp/crypto/detail/declassify.hpp`, written in Task 7
  (Step 5) with the BearSSL engine that uses it, is that mark. The documentation's page on
  constant time (`doc/aead.adoc`) says that the tag's verdict is the one value webcpp marks
  public, and that OpenSSL's verdict is OpenSSL's own internal branch, which webcpp cannot
  mark: OpenSSL's `open` is therefore checked with the key secret only during `seal`.
- [ ] **Step 1: Write `ctgrind_test.cpp`** (spec 8.3, deterministic, in the style of ctgrind),
  built with `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DETAIL_CT_VALGRIND`, which also proves it can fail: with
  `WEBCPP_TEST_CRYPTO_PLANTED_LEAK` it branches on a secret byte itself, and the lane expects
  that build to fail:

```cpp
// Copyright (c) 2026 WebCpp.org
//
// Distributed under the Boost Software License, Version 1.0. (See
// accompanying file LICENSE_1_0.txt or copy at
// https://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt)

// Under Valgrind's memcheck, the key, the plaintext and the tag are marked undefined: a
// branch or a memory index that depends on them is an error, and the run fails
// (--error-exitcode). It covers equal, and make, seal and open of BearSSL and OpenSSL.

    return failures;
}
```

  BearSSL's tag check (`EQ0`) is branch-free; its verdict, a value derived from the key and
  the tag, is declassified by the engine before `gcm` branches on it (Step 0), so memcheck
  reports a branch on a secret anywhere else. Valgrind may report inside libcrypto's own
  start-up code, which no secret reaches; a suppression file, `openssl.supp`, holds each such
  frame the first Linux run shows, each with its reason, never a frame of `seal`.
  `valgrind.mjs`:

```js

    process.exit(1)

```

  `msan_report.mjs`, the driver of `msan_planted` (n2): a `run-fail` would pass on any failure,
  a crash or a missing sanitizer runtime included, so the driver passes only on
  MemorySanitizer's report of the planted branch:

// llvm-symbolizer (llvm-symbolizer-18 on the lane's runner, installed with the lane's

  `package.json` is `{"name": "webcpp-crypto-constant-time", "private": true}` under no
  dependency, and `package-lock.json` npm's lockfile of it (`npm install --package-lock-only`
  writes it).
- [ ] **Step 2: Write `msan_test.cpp`**, the same checks through MemorySanitizer, every line
  of C and C++ instrumented: the test Jamfile builds BearSSL's sources once more with
  `-fsanitize=memory` (MemorySanitizer reports falsely through code it did not compile), and
  the program keeps BearSSL on its portable code (`WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DETAIL_BEARSSL_PORTABLE`),
  whose plain C MemorySanitizer follows exactly. It is built with
  `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DETAIL_CT_MSAN`, so that the engine declassifies the tag's verdict (Step 0),
  and a twin with `WEBCPP_TEST_CRYPTO_PLANTED_LEAK`, a branch on a poisoned byte, must be
  reported by MemorySanitizer (`webcpp.drive msan_planted` through `msan_report.mjs`, Step 4,
  which passes on that report alone, n2). It prints with `std::printf` alone, since libstdc++'s compiled parts
  are not instrumented.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write `dudect.hpp` and `dudect_test.cpp`** (spec 8.3, statistical): the
  method of Reparaz, Balasch and Verbauwhede (dudect, 2017): two classes of inputs, a fixed
  secret and random secrets, measured interleaved in random order, the measurements cropped
  at the percentiles `1 - 0.5^(10 * (k + 1) / 100)` for k in 0..99, and Welch's t-test on
  each cropped set and on the whole; the test fails when any `|t|` exceeds 10, dudect's
  threshold, after 2,000,000 measurements (about 1,000,000 per class). Timer:
  `std::chrono::steady_clock`, natively and under wasmtime. `dudect.hpp`:

  `measure` takes the seed as its first argument, and the program's `main` calls it through a

  `equal` compiles in the user's translation unit, so it is checked at both optimisations of
  spec 2.6: `ctgrind_test.cpp` built twice more, `ctgrind_speed` and `ctgrind_space`, with
  `<optimization>speed` and `<optimization>space`, each a `webcpp.drive` of its own named by
  the lane. `ctgrind_planted_test.cpp` and `msan_planted_test.cpp` are one line each,
  `#include "ctgrind_test.cpp"` and `#include "msan_test.cpp"`: a source of their own, so
  that b2 compiles each with its own defines (spec 4.3's pitfall). `msan` builds only with
  clang on Linux, where the lane runs; spec 8's table puts the deterministic checks on Linux
  x86-64 and arm64, and the lane is not run on macOS. On the CI the own lanes run on the
  runner, never in the container (`matrix.py`'s `run_own_lane` does not contain them, I10), so
  the lane's packages come with its entry: `matrix.py` gains
  `OWN_LANE_PACKAGES = {('crypto', 'constant-time'): ('valgrind', 'llvm-18')}` (`llvm-18`
  for `llvm-symbolizer-18`, which `msan_report.mjs` needs to read MemorySanitizer's frames,
  r2; a no-op where the image already has it), an own lane's entry gains
  `"apt"`, the list for its library and lane (`[]` otherwise), and library.yml's own-lanes job
  a step `if: runner.os == 'Linux' && join(matrix.apt, ' ') != ''` that runs
  `sudo apt-get install --yes --no-install-recommends ${{ join(matrix.apt, ' ') }}`;
  `matrix_test.py` gains its case. The runner's clang-18 brings MemorySanitizer's runtime.
- [ ] **Step 5: Run** the lane on a Linux machine with valgrind, clang-18 and llvm-symbolizer-18 (the CI's
  own-lanes job, or `python3 tools/ci/matrix.py own-lane '<the entry of own-lanes for
  constant-time on native>'` on such a machine), and on wasip2 locally. Expected: PASS;
  `ctgrind` prints `constant time under memcheck: ok`; `ctgrind_planted` passes on memcheck's
  exit status 99 alone and `msan_planted` on MemorySanitizer's report of the planted line
  alone (n2), each failing on any other way its program could end; each `|t|` printed is
  below 10. A `|t|` above 10 after the
  rerun is investigated (the program alone, the classes' means) before anything else; the
  threshold is never raised to pass. On macOS the native part of the lane is not run, which
  the ledger records; the CI and `runners.yml`'s arm64 job run it.
- [ ] **Step 6: Commit** (library) `"crypto: constant time under Valgrind, MemorySanitizer
  and dudect's statistics, each shown to fail on a planted leak"`; (superproject)
  `"tools/ci: an own lane's packages, installed with it"`.

## Task 21: A library named and not called adds no byte (`webcpp.same-program`)

**Files (superproject):**
- Create: `tools/same_program/same_program.jam`, `tools/same_program/compare.py`.
- Modify: `tools/webcpp.jam` (load the module; the rule), `tools/test/webcpp_jam_test.py`
  (cases), `AGENTS.md` (chapter 9's Jamfile API).
- Create (library): `test/unused/Jamfile`, `test/unused/app.cpp`.

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `webcpp.same-program <name> : <sources> + : <library> : <targets> * : <requirements> * ;`
  (C9): a test of type `SAME_PROGRAM`, listed by `--dump-tests` and recorded by `--out-xml`,
  that passes when `<sources>` built with `<library>` and without it, as two `exe`s of b2 under
  one output name in two directories of their own, give byte-identical files (on emscripten
  the `.js` and the `.wasm` beside it). `<requirements>` are properties
  (`<library>/webcpp/crypto//crypto`). No b2 runs inside b2 (owner item O4).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tools tests** in `tools/test/webcpp_jam_test.py`, on the
  fixture `demo` (a static library `unused` added to its `test/Jamfile` by the case, one
  function never called, and a program `hello.cpp`):
  - `test_a_library_named_and_not_called_adds_nothing`:
    `webcpp.same-program hello_unused : hello.cpp : unused ;` passes natively and on wasip2
    (`harness.link_wasi_tools`);
  - `test_a_library_called_differs`: with `hello.cpp` calling the function, the test fails,
    and its output names both files and their sizes;
  - `test_the_pair_shares_one_name`: `-d+2` shows both programs linked as `hello_unused`
    (`hello_unused.wasm` on wasip2) in two directories.
  Run them. Expected: FAIL, `webcpp.same-program` unknown.
- [ ] **Step 2: Write `tools/same_program/same_program.jam`:**

  In `tools/webcpp.jam`, after the drive module's load:

# webcpp-same-program, as the documentation's are.
modules.load webcpp-same-program : same_program.jam
  : [ path.native [ path.join $(.tools) same_program ] ] ;
import webcpp-same-program ;

# A test that builds sources with library and without it, under one output
# name, in two directories of their own, and passes when the two files are
# byte-identical: a library named and not called adds no byte (AGENTS.md
# chapter 6, rule 11).
rule same-program ( name : sources + : library : targets * : requirements * )
{
    local only = [ program same-program : $(name) : $(targets) ] ;
    webcpp-same-program.same-program [ where ] : $(name) : $(sources) : $(library) : $(only)
      : $(requirements) ;
}
```

  The `exe` rule is b2's, called from a module of `tools/`, as `webcpp.example` calls it: the
  lint's raw-rules check reads a library's test and example Jamfiles, not `tools/`.
- [ ] **Step 3: Run** the three tools cases. Expected: PASS. If the tag rule does not rename
  the emscripten pair's `.wasm` as it renames the `.js` (the asio plan measured the `.js`,
  `Q/b2-tag/`), `compare.py` reads the `.wasm` by the name the link wrote, which `-d+2` shows,
  and the case `test_the_pair_shares_one_name` gains the emscripten form; on MSVC, if
  `/Brepro` leaves the pair different, the first MSVC run records the differing bytes'
  offsets and the case is reported to the owner, the rule otherwise unchanged.
- [ ] **Step 4: Write crypto's cases** (spec 8.7), `test/unused/Jamfile`:

```jam

#
# Distributed under the Boost Software License, Version 1.0. (See
# accompanying file LICENSE_1_0.txt or copy at
# https://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt)

# A backend built from source, named and not called, adds no byte, on every
# target (spec sections 4.2 and 8.7). OpenSSL and Botan are left out: a shared
# library named adds its dependency.
import webcpp ;

webcpp.targets native wasip2 wasip3 emscripten ;

webcpp.same-program unused_bearssl : app.cpp : /third_party//bearssl
  : : <library>/webcpp/crypto//crypto ;
```

  `app.cpp` draws 16 bytes with `random_device` and prints them in hex (so that the program
  is crypto's and calls nothing of BearSSL's). Tasks 26 and 29 add libsecp256k1's and ctaes's
  lines. In `test/Jamfile`, `build-project unused ;`.
- [ ] **Step 5: Run** the four lanes. Expected: PASS: `unused_bearssl` on each target
  (C-LIBS:495-501 measured it on all four).
- [ ] **Step 6: Commit** (superproject, after `git add -- tools/same_program`)
  `"tools: webcpp.same-program, a library named and not called adds no byte"`; (library)
  `"crypto: BearSSL named and not called adds no byte on any target"`.

## Task 22: Sizes and throughput

**Files:**
- Create: `test/sizes/Jamfile`, `test/sizes/wasm/Jamfile`, `test/sizes/native/Jamfile`,
  `test/sizes/native_static/Jamfile`, `test/sizes/baseline.cpp`, `test/sizes/gcm_bearssl.cpp`,
  `test/sizes/gcm_openssl.cpp`, `test/sizes/sizes.py`, `doc/sizes.adoc` (generated, checked);
  `test/throughput/Jamfile`, `test/throughput/throughput.cpp`;
  `.github/workflows/runners.yml`.
- Modify: `test/Jamfile` (`build-project sizes ; build-project throughput ;`).

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: the own lanes `sizes` (native, wasip2, wasip3, emscripten) and `throughput`
  (native, wasip2, wasip3, emscripten); `sizes.py table <json>...` and `sizes.py doc <json>...`;
  the job summaries of `runners.yml`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the sized programs and their Jamfiles.** `baseline.cpp` prints
  `baseline` and returns 0; `gcm_bearssl.cpp` and `gcm_openssl.cpp` are spec 7.2's `app.cpp`
  with the backend named (`gcm<aes256<backends::bearssl>>`, resp. `openssl`), so that each
  measures its backend whatever the default. b2 skips a `make` whole when one of its sources
  is skipped on a target, and the build still succeeds (measured, review `R/skip_make_Jamroot`:
  "...found 1 target...", exit status 0, no file; I11). So every `make` of sizes lists only
  programs its Jamfile builds on every target it declares: one Jamfile per set of targets,
  `test/sizes/wasm/` (wasip2, wasip3, emscripten), `test/sizes/native/` (BearSSL and a shared
  OpenSSL) and `test/sizes/native_static/` (a static OpenSSL, which a machine without
  `libcrypto.a` leaves out with Task 11's line, alone). `test/sizes/wasm/Jamfile`:

```jam

#
# Distributed under the Boost Software License, Version 1.0. (See

# https://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt)

# The size of a program per backend on WebAssembly (spec section 8.8), each
# linked and never run, at b2's two optimisations of a release, speed (-O3 with
# clang) and space (-Os), stripped; written by sizes.py into sizes.json and
# compared with the documentation's table (doc/sizes.adoc). Every program here
# is built on every target this Jamfile declares, so the make below is never
# skipped whole on one of them (I11).

}

make sizes.json : $(.programs) : @sizes ;
explicit sizes.json ;
webcpp.lane sizes : sizes.json : wasip2 wasip3 emscripten ;
```

  `test/sizes/native/Jamfile` is the same with `webcpp.targets native ;`, the four BearSSL
  and baseline programs and `gcm_openssl_speed` (`<library>/third_party//openssl`), and
  `webcpp.lane sizes : sizes.json : native ;`; `test/sizes/native_static/Jamfile` holds
  `gcm_openssl_static_speed` (`<webcpp-crypto-openssl-link>static`) and its own `sizes.json`
  in the same lane. The three directories are `build-project`ed from `test/sizes/Jamfile`,
  which declares nothing else. `--expect` gives `sizes.py` the programs the make was written
  for: a program that is not among its sources fails the action, naming it, a second net
  under the split.

  `webcpp.target-of` is `tools/target.jam`'s `target-of`, exported by `tools/webcpp.jam` in
  this task (one line, `rule target-of ( properties * ) { return [ webcpp-target.target-of $(properties) ] ; }`,
  with its case in `tools/test/webcpp_jam_test.py`), and the same file gains a case that pins
  b2's behaviour this step works around, `test_a_make_with_a_skipped_source_is_skipped_whole`
  (the review's `skip_make_Jamroot`, so that a later b2 that changes it is noticed). Python is
  run as `python3`, as the other actions of `tools/` run it (`python` on Windows, through the
  same `if [ os.name ] = NT` of `tools/webcpp.jam`).
- [ ] **Step 2: Write `test/sizes/sizes.py`:**

  b2's `speed` is `-O3` with clang and gcc and spec 8.8 says -O2: the table measures what a
  user's b2 release builds (C17), and the documentation says which flags.
- [ ] **Step 3: Write the table.** The pinned toolchains should give the same WebAssembly bytes
  on macOS and Linux; that is measured first (m19): the lane `sizes` on wasip2 locally and in
  the CI's own lane, its two `sizes.json` compared. If they agree, the table may be written
  locally; if not, its WebAssembly rows are written from the CI's artifacts alone (the own
  lane's job uploads `sizes.json`, `gh run download` fetches it) and the check runs on the CI
  alone, which the action's comment says. Run the lane `sizes` on each target, each with its
  own build directory, then
  `python3 libs/crypto/test/sizes/sizes.py doc bin/lane-sizes-native/**/sizes.json bin/lane-sizes-wasip2/**/sizes.json bin/lane-sizes-wasip3/**/sizes.json bin/lane-sizes-emscripten/**/sizes.json > libs/crypto/doc/sizes.adoc`
  (expanding the globs with `find`), with the licence notice prepended. Run the lane again on
  wasip2. Expected: PASS. The BearSSL rows are compared with C-LIBS's (wasip2 -Os stripped
  59,887 bytes; Emscripten -Os 26,387): a difference of more than 5% is investigated (a flag
  of the build, the strip) before the table is committed.
- [ ] **Step 4: Write `test/throughput/throughput.cpp`:**

  actionlint job's command) and the lanes `sizes` and `throughput` natively. Expected:
  clean; PASS.
- [ ] **Step 7: Commit** (library) `"crypto: sizes per target and throughput per runner,
  the documentation's table checked where the toolchains are pinned"`; (superproject)
  `"tools: webcpp.target-of for a library's own actions"`.

## Task 23: The browser: WebCrypto as an outside oracle, the audio worklet, throughput in Chrome

**Files:**
- Create: `test/browser/Jamfile`, `test/browser/package.json`,
  `test/browser/package-lock.json`, `test/browser/run.mjs`, `test/browser/page.html`,
  `test/browser/webcrypto.cpp`, `test/browser/worklet.cpp`.
- Modify: `test/Jamfile` (`build-project browser ;`); (superproject) `tools/ci/matrix.py`
  (`CHROME_LANES` gains `('crypto', 'browser')`), `tools/ci/matrix_test.py`.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the driven-test rule `webcpp.drive` and its Chrome (the CI's `chrome` action
  gives `CHROME`), trystero's `findChrome` (`libs/trystero/test/oracle/interop/run.mjs`),
  copied with its comment.
- Produces: the own lane `browser` on emscripten.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the program** `webcrypto.cpp`, which reads a file of cases, one per
  line, `<key> <iv> <additional data> <plaintext> <ciphertext and tag>` in hex (`-` for an
  empty field), seals each with `aes128_gcm` or `aes256_gcm` on BearSSL by the key's size,
  compares, opens the expected form, and prints `webcrypto agrees: <n> cases` or each case
  that differs:

  It needs `-sAUDIO_WORKLET=1 -sWASM_WORKERS=1`, which need shared memory, while webcpp's
  Emscripten target is single-threaded (`<threading>single`, AGENTS chapter 9). Build it with
  `<threading>multi` in its own requirements, as the drive `worklet_chrome` (`run.mjs --chrome --page worklet`):
  - if it links and runs, it joins the lane `browser`, served with the cross-origin headers,
    and the page posts `not_supported`;
  - if it does not link (BearSSL's archive and the C library built without atomics refuse a
    shared memory: `wasm-ld: error: --shared-memory is disallowed by ... because it was not
    compiled with 'atomics' or 'bulk-memory' features`), the worklet's path of `read_entropy`
    is the `ENOTSUP` mapping that Task 4's planted source pins, the program is not added, and
    the owner is told that the worklet check needs a threaded variant of the Emscripten
    target, with the linker's message.

# The browser's tests (spec sections 8.1, 8.4, 8.8): node's and Chrome's WebCrypto

import webcpp ;

webcpp.original node ;

.web = <linkflags>-sENVIRONMENT=web <linkflags>-sEXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS=FS,callMain
    <linkflags>-sFORCE_FILESYSTEM=1 <linkflags>-sINVOKE_RUN=0 ;

# Under node the program reads the host's temporary file of cases: webcpp.drive
# links no -sNODERAWFS=1 (tools/webcpp.jam gives it to run, run-fail and

webcpp.drive webcrypto_node : webcrypto.cpp : <toolset>emscripten:<linkflags>-sNODERAWFS=1
  : run.mjs : --node : emscripten ;
webcpp.drive webcrypto_chrome : webcrypto.cpp : $(.web) <webcpp-drive-timeout>180

```

  (`worklet` joins it if Step 4 links.) In `tools/ci/matrix.py`,
  `CHROME_LANES = {('trystero', 'interop'), ('crypto', 'browser')}`, and `matrix_test.py`'s
  case for `CHROME_LANES` gains crypto's entry.
- [ ] **Step 6: Run** the lane on emscripten with `CHROME` naming the CI's pinned
  chrome-headless-shell (locally, Playwright's, found by the driver on macOS). Expected:
  PASS: `webcrypto agrees: 1012 cases` under node and in Chrome; the throughput's lines and
  `done`.
- [ ] **Step 7: Commit** (library) `"crypto: node's and Chrome's WebCrypto as oracles of
  AES-GCM, and the throughput in Chrome"`; (superproject) `"tools/ci: crypto's browser lane
  meets Chrome"`.

## Task 24: The documentation: the page, the user's Jamfiles, the examples

**Files:**
- Create, fixtures of Task 10's test under `tools/test/fixtures/crypto_jamfiles/` (each a
  `Jamfile`, its sources and an `.outcome`): `web/`, `server/`, `server_static/`,
  `both_bearssl_default/`, `memory/`.
- Create: `doc/jamfile.adoc`, `doc/aead.adoc`, `doc/block.adoc`, `doc/equal.adoc`,
  `doc/entropy.adoc`, `doc/backends.adoc`, `doc/memory.adoc`, `doc/errors.adoc`,
  `doc/performance.adoc`; `example/aes256_gcm_bearssl.cpp` and `.expected`,
  `example/equal_hmac.cpp` and `.expected`, `example/bearssl_prng.cpp` and `.expected` (m11).
- Modify: `doc/crypto.adoc`, `doc/overview.adoc`, `doc/testing.adoc`, `example/Jamfile`,
  `test/Jamfile` (the fixtures' sources compiled, m21), `README.md`; (superproject)
  `tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py` (the outcome line `same-as:`).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the user's Jamfiles of spec section 7**, fixtures of
  `tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py` (Task 10), each built and run on the targets the
  section names (its outcome's `targets:` line), so that every Jamfile line and every printed
  result of the page was built and run:

| Case | Jamfile (whole, after the licence notice) | Source | Targets | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `web` | `exe app : app.cpp /webcpp/crypto//crypto /third_party//bearssl ;` | spec 7.2's `app.cpp` | all four | `build: succeeds`, `run: app`, `aes256_gcm ok backend=bearssl` |
| `server` | `exe app : app.cpp /webcpp/crypto//crypto /third_party//openssl ;` | a copy of `web/app.cpp` | native | `root: OPENSSL_ROOT`, `same-as: web/app.cpp app.cpp`, `aes256_gcm ok backend=openssl` |
| `server_static` | `exe app : app.cpp /webcpp/crypto//crypto /third_party//openssl : <webcpp-crypto-openssl-link>static ;` | the same copy | native | `root: OPENSSL_ROOT`, `requires: static-libcrypto`, `aes256_gcm ok backend=openssl`, `no-dependency: app libcrypto` |
| `both_bearssl_default` | `exe app : app.cpp /webcpp/crypto//crypto /third_party//openssl /third_party//bearssl : <define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_BEARSSL ;` | the same copy | native | `root: OPENSSL_ROOT`, `aes256_gcm ok backend=bearssl` |
| `memory` | `project app : requirements <define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_OPENSSL_MEMORY_RESOURCE <library>/third_party//openssl ;` and `exe app : app.cpp /webcpp/crypto//crypto ;` | spec 7.3's memory `app.cpp` | native | `root: OPENSSL_ROOT`, `aes256_gcm ok backend=openssl` |

  Copies, not symbolic links: the tools job's nightly Windows leg (O4') checks out a link as a
  text file (`core.symlinks` off). Task 10's test gains the outcome line
  `same-as: <case>/<file> <file>`, two files that must be byte-identical, with a case of its
  self-check, so the copies cannot drift.
- [ ] **Step 2: Write the examples** the ordinary lanes run and clang-tidy reads:
  `example/aes256_gcm_bearssl.cpp`, spec 7.2's program with `gcm<aes256<backends::bearssl>>`
  named, expected `aes256_gcm ok backend=bearssl`; `example/equal_hmac.cpp`, an HMAC-SHA-256
  of Boost.Hash2 checked with `equal` against RFC 4231's test case 2 (key `Jefe`, data
  `what do ya want for nothing?`, tag
  `5bdcc146bf60754e6a042426089575c75a003f089d2739839dec58b964ec3843`), expected
  `hmac verified with equal`. In `example/Jamfile`:
  `webcpp.example aes256_gcm_bearssl.cpp : <library>/third_party//bearssl ;`,
  `webcpp.example equal_hmac.cpp ;` and
  `webcpp.example bearssl_prng.cpp : <library>/third_party//bearssl ;`, the last the program of
  `entropy.adoc` that seeds BearSSL's own PRNG (`br_hmac_drbg_init` with SHA-256 and 32 bytes
  of `random_device::fill`) and prints `seeded` (m11). The user's programs of the fixtures are
  compiled once each in the ordinary lanes, so that clang-tidy reads the documentation's code
  (m21): in `test/Jamfile`,
  `webcpp.compile doc_web_app : ../../../tools/test/fixtures/crypto_jamfiles/web/app.cpp : <library>/third_party//bearssl ;`
  and one line per other fixture's program with its libraries (natively for OpenSSL's), the
  failing cases (`canary_*`, `msvc_*`, `openssl_*` stops) excepted.
- [ ] **Step 3: Write the page's sections**, each a file of `doc/` included by
  `crypto.adoc` in this order, each holding what the spec section named says, rewritten for a
  user, with the code it shows included from a built file (`include::{webcpp-root}/tools/test/fixtures/crypto_jamfiles/<case>/Jamfile[]`,
  `include::{examples}/<file>[]`), never typed:
  - `overview.adoc` "Why crypto": spec 1.1, 1.2; what stays with Boost.Hash2.
  - `jamfile.adoc` "Using webcpp::crypto in your Jamfile", written so that an AI agent
    writes a correct Jamfile at once (DESIGN, 2026-10-11 "C libraries built from their own
    sources, and the backend named in the user's Jamfile"): first the rule in three lines
    (spec 7.1: name `/webcpp/crypto//crypto` and `/third_party//<backend>`; which backend for
    which target; a backend named and not called costs nothing); then each case of Step 1
    with its Jamfile, its source, its command and what it prints (7.2, 7.3, the static link,
    the choice of default, the memory option with its "What to know" list); the backends'
    table (7.6); every message and its fix (7.7), with the link-time messages as Tasks 16
    and 18 measured them on each linker; and, for Windows, spec 2.2's note: crypto's headers
    include `<windows.h>` under `NOMINMAX` and `WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN` when the program has not
    defined them, so a program that wants the macros `min` and `max`, or what
    `WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN` leaves out, includes `<windows.h>` itself before any header of
    crypto.
  - `aead.adoc` "AES-GCM": spec 2.4's interface and every decision of its "Decisions on the
    behaviour" as a rule for the user (in place with the tag apart; a failed open zeroes
    `data`; plaintext in `data` while `open` runs, and when to open into private memory; no
    incremental open; IVs of 1 to 128 bytes, 12 recommended; keys of 24 bytes and browsers'
    WebCrypto; the usage limit of 2^32 messages with random IVs; an IV never reused, with
    Joux's attack named; one thread at a time; not shareable), the guards' table, and the
    warning of spec 5 on ARM natively without OpenSSL.
  - `block.adoc` "The block cipher": spec 2.3; not encryption by itself; `aes256<backends::ctaes>`
    on WebAssembly (written now with the backends that exist, ctaes added by Task 29).
  - `equal.adoc` "Comparing tags": spec 2.6, with `example/equal_hmac.cpp`.
  - `entropy.adoc` "Entropy": spec 6 and 2.7: the one source per platform with its documented
    contract; no fallback; the errors; `operator()` with and without exceptions; seeding
    BearSSL's own PRNG from `random_device` (a code block built as `example/` is: a third
    example, `bearssl_prng.cpp`, which seeds `br_hmac_drbg_context` from 32 bytes of `fill`
    and prints `seeded`).
  - `backends.adoc` "The backends": spec 3.1's table; per backend its Jamfile line, its
    header, what it exports, its own API reachable, its allocation (BearSSL none; OpenSSL's
    `make` through OpenSSL's functions, the counts Task 17 printed for 3.0.13 and 3.6.4, the
    departure the owner accepted on 2026-10-11 and the option; Botan in Task 39), constant
    time (BearSSL's `bmul64` on a 32-bit WebAssembly host), its licence; the default per
    target (spec 5) with the reasons measured.
  - `memory.adoc` "Allocation": spec 2.11; no type is shareable, and why; the memory option
    (spec 3.7 for a user: the three things to do, the never-destroyed resource, what it
    routes and what it does not, the errors, a failing resource, one module).
  - `errors.adoc` "Errors and exceptions": the table of spec 2.9, the messages, spec 2.10.
  - `performance.adoc` "Sizes and throughput": `include::sizes.adoc[]` and the throughput the
    runners measured (`runners.yml`'s summaries, copied with the run's number and date).
  - `testing.adoc`: the lanes and own lanes, `{n-tests}`, the vectors and their counts, the
    report's address.
- [ ] **Step 4: Run** `$B2 -a --build-dir=bin/b-doc libs/crypto/doc`,
  `python3 tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py web server server_static both_bearssl_default memory`,
  and the examples in the ordinary lanes. Expected: PASS; doc-check
  finds nothing; the page shows every Jamfile and program from the tree.
- [ ] **Step 5: Check the text:** `grep -rn $'\xe2\x80\x94' libs/crypto` prints nothing;
  `git -C libs/crypto grep -I -i -e 'veru[s]'` prints nothing.
- [ ] **Step 6: Commit:** `"crypto: the page: every Jamfile a user writes, built and run on
  every target, and every message with its fix"`.

## Task 25: Increment 1 whole: the rulebook, green, review and the gates

**Files (superproject):**
- Modify: `AGENTS.md` (chapter 1's table of libraries and layout: crypto and `third_party/libs`'s
  new submodules; chapter 6's "Bringing a C library into webcpp": crypto named as its first
  user and both project ids; chapter 9: Task 10's fixtures and test, Task 21's rule, the knobs
  of Task 11; chapter 13: crypto's later increments, and its own lanes at the nightly level of
  Task 25b), `README.md` (a row for crypto), `CONTRIBUTING.md` (the guideline's project id
  note).

Tasks 25a and 25b follow this one: 25a waits for asio's Task 21, 25b for owner gate O2.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the rows.** AGENTS.md's table of libraries:
  `| crypto | Authenticated encryption, randomness and secp256k1 over C backends (BearSSL, OpenSSL; libsecp256k1, ctaes, Botan to come), webcpp's own | native, wasip2, wasip3, emscripten; own lanes c-suites, constant-time, browser, sizes, throughput | a local repository at libs/crypto until webcpporg/crypto exists (chapter 2) |`;
  README.md's table gains crypto with its targets. Commit:
  `"AGENTS.md, README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md: crypto, and the rules a C library's user meets"`.
- [ ] **Step 2: Run the definition of green** (AGENTS.md chapter 10), each from scratch,
  recording each result in the ledger:
  - the ordinary lanes: native (Apple clang), gcc-15, wasip2, wasip3, emscripten;
  - the own lanes, each on every target it names: `c-suites` on the four; `constant-time` on
    a Linux machine with valgrind, clang-18 and llvm-symbolizer-18 (natively) and on wasip2; `browser` on
    emscripten; `sizes` and `throughput` on the four;
  - `python3 tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py --require-external` (every fixture), its four
    `done in` times in the ledger and Task 10's 30-minute rule applied (m20);
  - `$B2 -a --build-dir=bin/b-doc doc` (the index lists crypto);
  - the lint: `lint: clean`;
  - the tools' tests touched: `tools/test/jamroot_test.py`, `tools/test/webcpp_jam_test.py`,
    `tools/test/external_test.py`, `tools/test/harness_test.py`,
    `tools/test/third_party_test.py`, `tools/lint/lint_test.py`, `tools/ci/matrix_test.py`,
    `tools/ci/actions_test.py`;
  - `python3 tools/ci/matrix.py plan --library crypto` (every native compiler and the three
    WebAssembly lanes, `externals` `["nist-cavp", "openssl"]` natively and `["nist-cavp"]` on
    WebAssembly) and `own-lanes --library crypto`: each own lane once per target it names (I2),
    `c-suites` on four targets, `sizes` on four, `throughput` on four, `constant-time` on two,
    `browser` on one with `chrome` true, each entry with its `externals` and `constant-time`'s
    with `apt` `["valgrind", "llvm-18"]`; after Task 25b, the same split by `--level`.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Dispatch the whole-increment review (the library and the superproject), on
  the most capable model, with this plan's Review Focus, its Conflicts, and the spec.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Fix what it finds, each with a failing test first.
- [ ] **Step 5 (controller, G1):** with the owner's agreement, the owner creates
  `webcpporg/crypto` (no other repository: O3's recommendation pins NIST's archives).
- [ ] **Step 6 (controller, G2):** the owner adds the submodule `libs/crypto`; the exclude
  line goes; the superproject commits it: `"libs/crypto: authenticated encryption and
  randomness over C backends"`.
- [ ] **Step 7 (controller, G4):** with the owner's agreement, push the library, then the
  superproject, rebased onto `main` at the rebase point after this task ("The base, the order
  of the tracks", point 3, its identity check giving `identity: ok` for both repositories before the
  push); watch both CIs and the report's columns for crypto.

## Task 25a: asio's OpenSSL onto `/third_party//openssl` (I14)

The asio plan's departure 4 (approved 2026-10-11) keeps `/webcpp/asio//openssl` on the
system's shared OpenSSL "until webcpp::crypto's `/third_party//openssl`", and asio's target
moves onto it then (WEBCPP_ASIO_PLAN.md, departure 4 and its Task 21). This task does that move,
so that a program of asio and crypto holds one libcrypto. Precondition: asio's Task 21 is on
this track's base (the rebase point after Task 25, "The base, the order of the tracks"); if it
is not, this task waits for it, and the ledger says so.

**Files (in `libs/asio`, on its branch):**
- Modify: `build.jam` (the targets `openssl` and `openssl-tests`), `test/Jamfile` (`ssl_static`;
  the stops' expected texts that name asio's own OpenSSL lookup), `doc/` (the page on TLS: the
  link feature and the one copy), `AGENTS.md` (departure 4 closed).
- Modify (superproject): `tools/test/third_party_test.py` (the cases of Step 1), AGENTS.md
  chapter 13 (asio's item on OpenSSL closed).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests.**
  - In asio's `test/Jamfile`, its `ssl` test built with `<webcpp-crypto-openssl-link>static`:
    `webcpp.run ssl_static : ssl_test.cpp : <library>/webcpp/asio//openssl-tests <webcpp-crypto-openssl-link>static : native ;`.
  - A case of `tools/test/third_party_test.py`: a program naming both `/webcpp/asio//openssl`
    and `/third_party//openssl` links `libcrypto` once natively (`-d+2`'s link line names it
    once).
  - The emscripten side stays as asio built it (N4), in the same file: on a scratch
    superproject, `b2 toolset=emscripten libs/asio/test//ssl_asyncify
    libs/asio/example/tls//asio_tls` builds both and exits 0. That success is the check (r4):
    were `/third_party//openssl` reached on emscripten, its WebAssembly stop (Task 11) would
    end the load with `OpenSSL is a native backend` and a nonzero status, so `openssl-tests`
    and the example's native-only condition are shown to add nothing there; b2's printed
    output is not searched for the target's name, which it never prints whether reached or
    not. A second case keeps asio's refusal: a program built for emscripten
    that names `/webcpp/asio//openssl` still stops at asio's forced include, whose message
    (asio's Task 21) the case states whole.

  Run asio's native lane and `python3 tools/test/third_party_test.py`. Expected: FAIL, the
  feature unknown to asio's target and two `libcrypto` on the line; the emscripten cases pass
  before the change and are there to keep passing.
- [ ] **Step 2: Move the targets.** In asio's `build.jam`, the lines `local openssl-root =
  [ webcpp.external asio : OpenSSL ... ]`, the four `lib openssl-ssl` / `lib openssl-crypto`
  alternatives, `openssl-required` and `openssl-for-tests` go. `/third_party//openssl` is named
  through asio's own native-only `<conditional>` rule, the form asio's Task 21 measured to work
  (never the negated `<toolset>!emscripten:<library>...`, which links nothing, measured there):

```jam
# OpenSSL 3, natively, from /third_party//openssl: libssl and libcrypto as one
# choice, shared or static by <webcpp-crypto-openssl-link>, so that a program
# of asio and webcpp::crypto holds one libcrypto. /third_party//openssl stops
# a user's build when the machine lacks OpenSSL and leaves webcpp's own tests
# out (webcpp-own). Named only natively: on emscripten the ssl names are a
# record of the settings that links nothing, and /third_party//openssl would
# stop the build there.
rule openssl-linked ( properties * )
{
    if ! <toolset>emscripten in $(properties)
    {
        return <library>/third_party//openssl <define>WEBCPP_ASIO_HAS_OPENSSL=1 ;
    }
}

# Refused on WebAssembly, as before: every source of a program built for
# emscripten that names it stops at the forced include.
path-constant WEBCPP_ASIO_ROOT : . ;
alias openssl : : : : <conditional>@openssl-linked
    <toolset>emscripten:<compileflags>"-include \"$(WEBCPP_ASIO_ROOT)/src/openssl_on_webassembly.hpp\"" ;

# asio's own tests: the same natively; on emscripten nothing, for the
# ssl_asyncify twin, as asio built it.
alias openssl-tests : : : : <conditional>@openssl-linked ;
explicit openssl-tests ;
```

  The stop a user meets natively is then `/third_party//openssl`'s (Task 11's text), and asio's
  tests that pinned asio's own stop text pin that one. `tools/ci/matrix.py`'s
  `EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCIES['asio']` stays `('openssl',)`.
- [ ] **Step 3: Run** asio's lanes: native, gcc-15, emscripten, and its own lanes `asyncify`
  (emscripten, `ssl_asyncify` among its programs), `browser` and `tls` (native and
  emscripten); crypto's native lane; `python3 tools/test/third_party_test.py`. Expected: PASS,
  `ssl_asyncify` and `emscripten.asio.tls` among the passes.
- [ ] **Step 4: Commit** (asio) `"asio: OpenSSL through /third_party//openssl, shared or
  static, one libcrypto with webcpp::crypto"`; (superproject) `"AGENTS.md: asio's OpenSSL is
  /third_party//openssl"`.

## Task 25b: The nightly level: the heavy own lanes, asio's asyncify, the tools' macOS and Windows legs (owner gate O2)

Written with the controller's recommendation for O2; if the owner keeps every lane on every
push instead, this task is dropped, `runners.yml` (Task 22) takes back its push trigger, and
the tools job's macOS and Windows legs run on every push.

What the nightly level runs, plainly (N5): `nightly.yml` does **not** rerun any library's
ordinary lanes, docs, lint or Linux tools tests; those stay on every push, as today. Each night
it runs only:
- the own lanes of `NIGHTLY_LANES`: crypto's `c-suites`, `constant-time`, `browser` and
  `throughput`, and asio's `asyncify` (DESIGN 2026-10-10 "webcpp::asio, section 11" puts
  Asyncify at the nightly and release levels; the asio plan's departure 1, approved
  2026-10-11, keeps it on every push only until the CI's levels exist, which this task makes);
- the tools job's `macos-15` and `windows-2022` legs, `crypto_jamfiles_test.py --target native`
  alone, for ld64's and MSVC's messages (O4', the controller's ruling: free minutes on the
  public repository, the cost being concurrency and wall time, so not on every push);
- the report job, which publishes those results (r3).

Where the nightly level runs (r3): only in the superproject, from `nightly.yml` on `main`. A
library repository's CI calls `library.yml@main` with its library and no level, so `push`
(trystero's `ci.yml` today), and never runs a nightly lane; each night the superproject tests
the library commits its `main` pins. The one scheduled workflow of a library is crypto's
`runners.yml` (Task 22, C4 and C16), which is not a lane of the matrix: it measures throughput
and constant time on the runners the matrix has no lane for (`ubuntu-24.04-arm`, `macos-15`),
at 03:17 UTC, on the library's own `main`.

**Files (superproject):**
- Modify: `tools/ci/matrix.py` (`NIGHTLY_LANES`; `own-lanes --level push|nightly`),
  `tools/ci/matrix_test.py`, `.github/workflows/library.yml` (the input `level`, default
  `push`; every job but `plan`, `own-lanes`, the tools job's nightly legs and `report`
  skipped at `nightly`; the report's nightly form), AGENTS.md (chapter 9's CI; chapter 13's levels item, m17), and asio's ledger and
  AGENTS.md (departure 1 closed: `asyncify` is nightly).
- Create: `.github/workflows/nightly.yml`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing cases** in `tools/ci/matrix_test.py`:
  - `own-lanes --library crypto --level push` lists `sizes` alone among crypto's own lanes,
    and `--level nightly` lists `c-suites`, `constant-time`, `browser` and `throughput`;
  - `own-lanes --library asio --level push` lists `browser` and `tls` and not `asyncify`, and
    `--level nightly` lists `asyncify` alone;
  - every other library's own lanes are unchanged at `push` (trystero's `oracle` and
    `interop`, wasi's `http`, xstate's oracle) and absent at `nightly`;
  - a pair of `NIGHTLY_LANES` whose library declares no such lane is left out of the listing
    silently only when the library is not checked out (asio before its integration), and
    fails the listing by name when the library is there and lacks the lane (a renamed lane);
  - `plan --level nightly` gives an empty matrix of ordinary lanes, and `report` with that
    empty plan, the nightly own lanes and their XML writes a test matrix of those lanes alone,
    titled with the level (`webcpp nightly <date>`), with no column missing for an ordinary
    lane that did not run (r3).
  Run `python3 tools/ci/matrix_test.py`. Expected: FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 2: Write it.**
  - `matrix.py`:
    `NIGHTLY_LANES = {('crypto', 'c-suites'), ('crypto', 'constant-time'), ('crypto', 'browser'), ('crypto', 'throughput'), ('asio', 'asyncify')}`,
    with a comment naming spec 8's table and DESIGN's asio section 11; `own-lanes` takes
    `--level`, `push` by default, and lists the lanes of `NIGHTLY_LANES` at `nightly` alone
    and the others at `push` alone; `plan` takes `--level` too and gives no ordinary lane at
    `nightly`; `report` takes `--level` and titles the matrix with it.
  - `library.yml`: `inputs.level` (`type: string`, default `push`), which the plan job passes
    to `plan` and `own-lanes`; `container`, `lanes`, `docs`, `lint` and `actionlint` gain
    `if: inputs.level != 'nightly'` (joined to their existing conditions); the `report` job
    runs at both levels, passes `--level` to `matrix.py report`, uploads its artifact as
    `report` at `push` and `report-nightly` at `nightly`, writes the matrix into the job's
    summary too, and its last step expects `lanes` skipped at `nightly` (success at `push`,
    as today) and `own-lanes` success whenever the plan found own lanes; the `tools` job
    becomes a matrix, `ubuntu-24.04` at `push` (its steps unchanged) and `macos-15` and
    `windows-2022` at `nightly`, whose steps install the actions the native lane of that OS
    installs (`boost`, `openssl`, `nist-cavp`) and run
    `python3 tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py --target native --require-external` alone.
    The nightly results are seen in the `nightly.yml` run of the superproject's Actions page:
    the report job's summary and its `report-nightly` artifact, and the run's status; a red
    night is a failed run of `main`, which GitHub notifies as any failed run.
  - `.github/workflows/nightly.yml`, scheduled at `0 2 * * *` on `main` and on
    `workflow_dispatch`, calls `./.github/workflows/library.yml` with `level: nightly` and no
    library, as `ci.yml` calls it, `permissions: contents: read`; and `runners.yml` (Task 22)
    keeps its own schedule.
  - AGENTS.md chapter 9 names the level, the workflow, what it runs (the list above), where
    its results are seen (the report job's summary and `report-nightly`), and that library
    repositories never run nightly lanes, `runners.yml` being crypto's measurement and not a
    lane;
    chapter 13's levels item says the nightly level exists for these own lanes and the tools'
    macOS and Windows legs, and that the ordinary lanes' levels, the native lanes without
    exceptions, the release level and crypto's `asyncify` variant are still to come (m16,
    m17).
  Run the case, `actionlint` and the lint. Expected: PASS. Then, with the owner's agreement
  (G4), one `workflow_dispatch` of `nightly.yml` on the pushed branch: its jobs are `plan`,
  the own lanes above, the two tools legs and `report`, whose summary lists the nightly lanes
  alone, and nothing else.
- [ ] **Step 3: Commit:** `"tools/ci: the nightly level: the heavy own lanes, asio's asyncify
  and the tools' macOS and Windows legs"` (after `git add -- .github/workflows/nightly.yml`).

# Increment 2: libsecp256k1 and ctaes

## Task 26: libsecp256k1 built file by file, its tables, its canary and its own tests

**Files:**
- Create (superproject): the submodule `third_party/libs/secp256k1`.
- Modify (superproject): `.gitmodules`, `third_party/Jamfile` (the feature and the target),
  `tools/test/third_party_test.py` (its cases).
- Create (library): `src/canary_secp256k1.c`, `include/webcpp/crypto/backends/secp256k1.hpp`,
  `test/messages/secp256k1_not_linked/`, `LICENSE-SECP256K1.txt` (a copy of the submodule's
  `COPYING`, MIT, which the README names, as `LICENSE-BEARSSL.txt` is BearSSL's).
- Modify (library): `include/webcpp/crypto/detail/canary.h` (the pin),
  `test/c_suites/Jamfile` (`tests.c`), `test/constant_time/Jamfile` (`ctime_tests.c`),
  `test/messages/Jamfile`, `test/unused/Jamfile`.

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `/third_party//secp256k1`; the feature `webcpp-secp256k1-tables`
  (`auto`, `small`, `large`, propagated); the usage requirement
  `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_SECP256K1_SMALL_TABLES=1` where the tables are small;
  `struct webcpp::crypto::backends::secp256k1 { static constexpr std::string_view name = "secp256k1"; };`;
  the macro `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DETAIL_SECP256K1_CANARY`; the canary
  `webcpp_crypto_secp256k1_6e2c8bc_<w15c11x6|w2c2x5>__add_third_party_secp256k1_to_your_link`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the submodule:**

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1.git third_party/libs/secp256k1
git -C third_party/libs/secp256k1 checkout 6e2c8bc4ecdc6e71dbe7a368f360d8d453ce435d
git -C third_party/libs/secp256k1 describe --tags
```

  Expected: `v0.8.0`.
- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing tests** in `tools/test/third_party_test.py`: the target
  builds 4 C files (`src/secp256k1.c`, `src/precomputed_ecmult.c`,
  `src/precomputed_ecmult_gen.c`, the canary) with the seven `ENABLE_MODULE_*=1` defines and,
  natively, no table define (libsecp256k1's defaults are the large tables, window 15 and comb
  11x6, `src/ecmult.h`, `src/ecmult_gen.h`), and the archive defines
  `webcpp_crypto_secp256k1_6e2c8bc_w15c11x6__add_third_party_secp256k1_to_your_link`; with
  `webcpp-secp256k1-tables=small` the three small defines and the canary `w2c2x5`; with
  `toolset=emscripten` and no request, the same small defines and canary. And the message
  test `test/messages/secp256k1_not_linked/` (native, wasip2), whose source includes
  `<webcpp/crypto/secp256k1.hpp>` and states spec 4.3's sixth row. Run them. Expected: FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 3: Write the target** in `third_party/Jamfile`:

```jam
# The precomputed tables of libsecp256k1 (spec section 3.5): auto (the
# default) is small on Emscripten, the web's target, and large natively and on
# WASI, the servers' (a ruling, spec section 10); small is window 2 and comb
# 2x5, about 1 MB smaller and a third slower to verify; large is the library's
# default, window 15 and comb 11x6. Propagated, so that a program's request
# reaches the library.
feature.feature webcpp-secp256k1-tables : auto small large : propagated ;

# libsecp256k1 v0.8.0 (MIT) as its CMake builds it: src/secp256k1.c and the two
# precomputed tables, with every module, recovery included. A program that
# uses MSVC's static library needs SECP256K1_STATIC, or the header declares
# every function imported from a DLL.
.marker.secp256k1 = include/secp256k1.h ;
.secp256k1-small = <define>ECMULT_WINDOW_SIZE=2 <define>COMB_BLOCKS=2 <define>COMB_TEETH=5 ;
lib secp256k1
  : libs/secp256k1/src/secp256k1.c libs/secp256k1/src/precomputed_ecmult.c
    libs/secp256k1/src/precomputed_ecmult_gen.c $(CRYPTO)/src/canary_secp256k1.c
  : $(.c-library) <webcpp-c-library>secp256k1 <conditional>@c-library-checked-out
    <include>libs/secp256k1/include <include>libs/secp256k1/src

    <define>ENABLE_MODULE_SILENTPAYMENTS=1 <toolset>msvc:<define>SECP256K1_STATIC
    <webcpp-secp256k1-tables>small:$(.secp256k1-small)
    <toolset>emscripten,<webcpp-secp256k1-tables>auto:$(.secp256k1-small)
  : : <include>libs/secp256k1/include <define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_HAS_SECP256K1=1
    <toolset>msvc:<define>SECP256K1_STATIC

    $(.gc) ;
explicit secp256k1 ;
```

  `<webcpp-secp256k1-tables>small:$(.secp256k1-small)` expands to the condition on each of
  the three defines (Jam's product: a condition followed by a list gives one conditional
  property per element); the step checks it in the test's `-d+2` output.
- [ ] **Step 4: Write the canary and the backend's header.** `src/canary_secp256k1.c` is the
  prototype's (`PROBES jam/crypto/src/canary_secp256k1.c`) with the commit through
  `detail/canary.h`, which gains:

```c

- [ ] **Step 5: libsecp256k1's own tests on webcpp's build** (spec 8.1, AGENTS rule 11). In
  `test/c_suites/Jamfile`: `src/tests.c` includes `secp256k1.c` itself (`src/tests.c:21`),
  so it is built alone with the library's defines, never linked with the archive:

```jam
# libsecp256k1's tests, which include secp256k1.c and so recompile it with these
# defines, third_party/Jamfile's for the library (a change of one is a change of
# both), and VERIFY, as libsecp256k1's CMake builds them. The archive webcpp
# links is tested by the vectors of the library's own tests.
path-constant SECP256K1 : ../../../../third_party/libs/secp256k1 ;
.secp256k1 = <include>$(SECP256K1)/include <include>$(SECP256K1)/src
    <define>ENABLE_MODULE_ECDH=1 <define>ENABLE_MODULE_RECOVERY=1
    <define>ENABLE_MODULE_EXTRAKEYS=1 <define>ENABLE_MODULE_SCHNORRSIG=1
    <define>ENABLE_MODULE_MUSIG=1 <define>ENABLE_MODULE_ELLSWIFT=1
    <define>ENABLE_MODULE_SILENTPAYMENTS=1 <warnings>off <warnings-as-errors>off ;
# Optimised in every variant: VERIFY's checks at -O0 under wasmtime and node would
# not end within the own-lanes job's 60 minutes (measured in Step 6).
webcpp.run secp256k1_tests : $(SECP256K1)/src/tests.c
  : $(.secp256k1) <define>VERIFY <optimization>speed ;
```

  and the lane's list gains `secp256k1_tests`. Its time is measured on each target in
  Step 6 (m6): the framework runs 16 iterations of each test unless told otherwise
  (`src/unit_test.c`, `--iterations=<num>`, default 16). A target on which one run passes
  20 minutes, a third of the job's 60, takes `<testing.arg>--iterations=4` by a conditional
  on that target, with the measured times in the comment above; natively it stays at 16, so
  the lane on the native compilers runs the suite as libsecp256k1's CI does. `src/ctime_tests.c` joins the lane
  `constant-time` (spec 8.3), built with the library's defines and `VALGRIND`, linked with
  `/third_party//secp256k1`, and driven by `valgrind.mjs`:

```jam
webcpp.drive secp256k1_ctime : $(SECP256K1)/src/ctime_tests.c
  : <library>/third_party//secp256k1 <include>$(SECP256K1)/src <define>VALGRIND
    <warnings>off <warnings-as-errors>off <webcpp-drive-timeout>600
  : valgrind.mjs : : native ;
```

  with `path-constant SECP256K1 : ../../../../third_party/libs/secp256k1 ;` in that Jamfile
  and `secp256k1_ctime` in its lane. The unused-library case gains
  `webcpp.same-program unused_secp256k1 : app.cpp : /third_party//secp256k1 : : <library>/webcpp/crypto//crypto ;`.
- [ ] **Step 6: Run** the third-party test, the message test, the lane `c-suites` on the four
  targets, `constant-time` on a Linux machine with valgrind (I10), and `unused` on the four.
  Expected: PASS. Record `secp256k1_tests`' time on each of the four targets in the ledger
  (m6) and apply Step 5's rule.
  `secp256k1_tests` on WASI: its framework forks workers only with `SUPPORTS_CONCURRENCY`
  (`src/unit_test.c:10`), sequential by default; if a target lacks what it needs (a `fork`
  declared but missing on WASI), the program is built with `SUPPORTS_CONCURRENCY` undefined
  there, by the macro libsecp256k1 uses, with the reason in the Jamfile.
- [ ] **Step 7: Commit** (superproject) `"third_party: libsecp256k1 v0.8.0, its tables by
  target, with webcpp::crypto's canary"`; (library) `"crypto: libsecp256k1's backend header,
  its canary, and its own tests on webcpp's build"`.

## Task 27: `secp256k1::keypair`, `verify_schnorr` and `verify_ecdsa`

**Files:**
- Create: `include/webcpp/crypto/secp256k1.hpp`, `test/secp256k1_test.cpp`,
  `test/secp256k1_allocation_test.cpp`.
- Modify: `include/webcpp/crypto.hpp`, `test/Jamfile`.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `backends::secp256k1`, `random_device`, `detail::wipe`, `error`.
- Produces: spec 2.8's interface exactly: `webcpp::crypto::secp256k1::basic_keypair<Backend>`
  with `make(secret, memory)`, `xonly_public_key()`, `public_key()`, `sign_schnorr(message, aux)`,
  `sign_ecdsa(hash)`, `ecdh(public_key)`; `using keypair = basic_keypair<>;`;
  `verify_schnorr<Backend>(signature, message, xonly_public_key)`,
  `verify_ecdsa<Backend>(signature, hash, public_key)`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** `test/secp256k1_test.cpp`:

  `test/secp256k1_allocation_test.cpp` (spec 8.5): a counting `std::pmr::memory_resource`
  given to `make`, and `support/counting.hpp`'s `operator new`: `make` allocates exactly once
  in the resource (the context, of `secp256k1_context_preallocated_size(SECP256K1_CONTEXT_NONE)`
  bytes, aligned to `alignof(std::max_align_t)`) and never through `operator new`; the
  signatures, `ecdh`, the public keys and both verifications allocate nothing; the destructor
  gives the block back. In `test/Jamfile`:

```jam
crypto-run secp256k1 : secp256k1_test.cpp : <library>/third_party//secp256k1 ;
crypto-run secp256k1_allocation : secp256k1_allocation_test.cpp

```

  Run the native lane. Expected: FAIL, `secp256k1.hpp` not found.

  `crypto/backends/secp256k1.hpp` with `<library>/third_party//secp256k1` on the four
  targets.
- [ ] **Step 3: Run** the four lanes. Expected: PASS, `secp256k1`, `secp256k1_allocation`
  and their twins on every target (the moved-from twins too: no exception is involved).
- [ ] **Step 4: Commit:** `"crypto: secp256k1's key pair, BIP340 and ECDSA signatures, their
  verifications and ECDH on libsecp256k1"`.

## Task 28: secp256k1's vectors: BIP340, Wycheproof's Bitcoin ECDSA, and ECDH

**Files:**
- Create (superproject): the submodule `third_party/libs/bips` (C12).
- Modify (superproject): `.gitmodules`, `third_party/Jamfile` (the target `bips`).
- Create (library): `test/secp256k1_bip340_test.cpp`, `test/secp256k1_wycheproof_test.cpp`.
- Modify (library): `test/Jamfile`.

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `/third_party//bips` (define `WEBCPP_TEST_BIPS`, the checkout's absolute path, and
  the directory under wasmtime).

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the submodule** (shallow from the first clone, m10: `shallow = true` in
  `.gitmodules` reaches later clones only, so the add itself takes `--depth 1` and the pinned
  commit is fetched alone):

```bash
git submodule add --depth 1 https://github.com/bitcoin/bips.git third_party/libs/bips
git -C third_party/libs/bips fetch --depth 1 origin 927b6de9915c9262615a6399de51b200f81e5aa4
git -C third_party/libs/bips checkout 927b6de9915c9262615a6399de51b200f81e5aa4
git config -f .gitmodules submodule.third_party/libs/bips.shallow true
git -C third_party/libs/bips rev-parse HEAD:bip-0340/test-vectors.csv
```

  Expected: `672339129a844a060591bb22f444158ff45438ed`, the blob of the CSV at the pin (its
  last change is `200f9b2`, M6; a shallow checkout has no history to show it, so the blob is
  what is checked; measured 2026-10-11 with these commands, 9.4 MB in `.git/modules`). The target `bips` in `third_party/Jamfile` is `wycheproof`'s
  with the marker `bip-0340/test-vectors.csv` and the define `WEBCPP_TEST_BIPS`.
- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing tests.** `test/secp256k1_bip340_test.cpp`: it reads
  `WEBCPP_TEST_BIPS "/bip-0340/test-vectors.csv"`, whose header is
  `index,secret key,public key,aux_rand,message,signature,verification result,comment`; for
  each row with a secret key it makes a `keypair`, checks `xonly_public_key()` against the
  public key, signs the message (of any length, empty included) with `aux_rand` and compares
  with the signature, as bytes (the CSV's hex is upper-case, `from_hex` reads both); for every row it calls `verify_schnorr` and expects success when the
  result is `TRUE`; rows 5 ("public key not on the curve") and 14 ("public key is not a
  valid X coordinate because it exceeds the field size") give `invalid_public_key`, and the
  other `FALSE` rows `invalid_signature`. Asserted, as read at the pin on 2026-10-11: 19 rows
  (0 to 18), 8 of them with a secret key, signed and compared, 9 `TRUE`, 2 refused keys,
  8 refused signatures. The CSV is split on commas; no field of it holds one, and a row's
  last field, the comment, may be empty. `test/secp256k1_wycheproof_test.cpp` (spec 8.1,
  CR-PROBES `secp/wp_secp.out`):
  - ECDSA, `testvectors_v1/ecdsa_secp256k1_sha256_bitcoin_test.json` (464 tests): each
    group's `publicKey.uncompressed`, each test's `msg` hashed with Boost.Hash2's SHA-256, its
    DER `sig` converted with `secp256k1_ecdsa_signature_parse_der` and
    `secp256k1_ecdsa_signature_serialize_compact` on `secp256k1_context_static`; a DER the
    parser refuses is counted as skipped (an encoding webcpp's compact interface does not
    take); the others go through `verify_ecdsa`, a valid one succeeding and an invalid one
    giving `invalid_signature`. Asserted: 162 valid verified, 190 skipped, 112 invalid refused;
  - ECDH through the C API (`secp256k1_ecdh` with a hash function of the test's that copies
    x), on `ecdh_secp256k1_test.json` (752 tests, ASN.1 public keys) and
    `ecdh_secp256k1_webcrypto_test.json` (496, JWK): the SEC1 point taken out of a key in the
    standard secp256k1 encoding (the ASN.1 `SubjectPublicKeyInfo` whose prefix is the
    secp256k1 one, `3056301006072a8648ce3d020106052b8104000a034200`, or a JWK of `crv`
    `secp256k1`), the others skipped with that reason; asserted: ASN.1 474 agree, 22 refused,
    256 skipped; JWK 473 agree, 20 refused, 3 skipped (tcId 490 among them, a valid point
    labelled `P-256`); every key the C API refuses also gives `invalid_public_key` through
    `keypair::ecdh`;
  - webcpp's `ecdh` equals the SHA-256 of the compressed shared point the C API computes with
    its default hash, on every valid ECDH case: `keypair::make(private)`, `ecdh(point)`
    against `secp256k1_ecdh(..., nullptr, nullptr)`;
  - the private keys are normalised to the 32 bytes `keypair::make` and `secp256k1_ecdh`
    take (m5), by one function of the test, `scalar32`: in `ecdh_secp256k1_test.json` the
    `private` field is hex of the ASN.1 integer, 274 of 32 bytes, 476 of 33 (a leading `00`,
    the sign byte), one of 1 byte (tcId 459, `03`) and one of 29 (tcId 460, `00` and 28
    bytes `ff`); `scalar32` drops leading zero bytes and left-pads with zeros to 32, and a
    value longer than 32 bytes once stripped fails the test by name (none at the pin). In
    `ecdh_secp256k1_webcrypto_test.json` the `private` field is a JWK whose `d` is
    base64url without padding, 32 bytes in all 496 cases; a small base64url decoder in the
    test reads it (no padding, `-` and `_`, any other character a failure by name) and the
    result goes through the same `scalar32`. Counted at the pin on 2026-10-11 from the
    files themselves.
  In `test/Jamfile`:

```jam
crypto-run secp256k1_bip340 : secp256k1_bip340_test.cpp
  : <library>/third_party//secp256k1 <library>/third_party//bips ;
crypto-run secp256k1_wycheproof : secp256k1_wycheproof_test.cpp
  : <library>/third_party//secp256k1 <library>/third_party//wycheproof
    <library>/webcpp//boost_json ;
```

  Run the four lanes. Expected: FAIL first on the reader; PASS once written, with every count
  above.
- [ ] **Step 3: Commit** (superproject) `"third_party: bitcoin/bips, for BIP340's vectors"`;
  (library) `"crypto: secp256k1 against BIP340, Wycheproof's Bitcoin ECDSA, and its ECDH"`.

## Task 29: ctaes, Bitcoin Core's copy: the block cipher alone

**Files:**
- Create (superproject): the submodule `third_party/libs/ctaes` (`bitcoin/bitcoin` at v31.1,
  shallow).
- Modify (superproject): `.gitmodules`, `third_party/Jamfile` (the target `ctaes`),
  `tools/test/third_party_test.py`.
- Create (library): `LICENSE-CTAES.txt` (a copy of `src/crypto/ctaes/COPYING` at the pin,
  MIT), `src/canary_ctaes.c`, `include/webcpp/crypto/backends/ctaes.hpp`,
  `test/aes_ctaes_test.cpp`, `test/agreement_aes_test.cpp`,
  `test/messages/ctaes_not_linked/`, `test/messages/gcm_on_ctaes/`,
  and, fixtures of Task 10's test under `tools/test/fixtures/crypto_jamfiles/`: `block/`, `sign/`,
  `sign_small/`, `encrypt_and_sign/`, `msvc_gcm_on_ctaes/`, `canary_secp256k1_missing/`,
  `canary_secp256k1_small/`, `canary_ctaes_missing/`.
- Modify (library): `include/webcpp/crypto/detail/canary.h`, `include/webcpp/crypto.hpp`,
  `test/Jamfile`, `test/c_suites/Jamfile` (ctaes's `test.c`), `test/unused/Jamfile`,
  `test/sizes/wasm/Jamfile` and `test/sizes/native/Jamfile` (the signing program, both
  tables), `test/messages/Jamfile`, `doc/block.adoc`, `doc/jamfile.adoc`, `doc/backends.adoc`, and a
  new `doc/secp256k1.adoc`.

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `/third_party//ctaes`; `backends::ctaes` (`name = "ctaes"`); `block_state` and
  `block_engine` for ctaes and 16, 24, 32; `gcm_state<backends::ctaes, K>` holding the
  refusal of spec 2.4; the canary `webcpp_crypto_ctaes_9be056a_default__add_third_party_ctaes_to_your_link`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the submodule** (spec 3.4), shallow from the first clone (m10: Bitcoin
  Core's whole history is several hundred megabytes, and `shallow = true` in `.gitmodules`
  reaches later clones only), Task 9's and Task 28's form:

```bash
git submodule add --depth 1 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git third_party/libs/ctaes
git -C third_party/libs/ctaes fetch --depth 1 origin 9be056a8a72b624dae9623b2f7bded92c2a21c91
git -C third_party/libs/ctaes checkout 9be056a8a72b624dae9623b2f7bded92c2a21c91
git config -f .gitmodules submodule.third_party/libs/ctaes.shallow true
git -C third_party/libs/ctaes rev-parse HEAD:src/crypto/ctaes
```

  Expected: `1b6c31139a71f80245c09597c343936a8e41d021`.
- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing tests**: in `third_party_test.py`, the target compiles 2
  files (`src/crypto/ctaes/ctaes.c` and the canary) and defines
  `webcpp_crypto_ctaes_9be056a_default__add_third_party_ctaes_to_your_link`;
  `test/aes_ctaes_test.cpp` calls Task 12's `check_fips197`, `check_aes_kat`,
  `check_aes_guards` and `check_aes_moved_from` for `ctaes`, on every target;
  `test/agreement_aes_test.cpp` (native): ctaes against OpenSSL on 10,000 random keys of each
  size and random messages of 0 to 64 blocks, from a seeded generator, encrypt and decrypt
  byte-identical (spec 8.2's second row); the messages `ctaes_not_linked` (spec 4.3's fifth
  row, `<define>` none and the source naming `aes256<backends::ctaes>` after including
  `backends/ctaes.hpp`) and `gcm_on_ctaes` (the source makes a `gcm<aes256<backends::ctaes>>`
  and states spec 2.4's text,
  `webcpp::crypto: gcm<aes256<backends::ctaes>>: ctaes exports the AES block cipher alone, and webcpp builds no GCM on another library's AES. Use a backend that exports GCM: gcm<aes256<backends::bearssl>>, gcm<aes256<backends::openssl>> or gcm<aes256<backends::botan>>.`).
  Run them. Expected: FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 3: Write the target** in `third_party/Jamfile`:

```jam
# ctaes (MIT), Pieter Wuille's constant-time AES as Bitcoin Core v31.1 ships it
# in src/crypto/ctaes (the owner's "ctaes do Bitcoin Core", spec section 3.4):
# the submodule is Bitcoin Core's tree at the tag, shallow, and its one file of
# the library is compiled.
.marker.ctaes = src/crypto/ctaes/ctaes.h ;
lib ctaes : libs/ctaes/src/crypto/ctaes/ctaes.c $(CRYPTO)/src/canary_ctaes.c
  : $(.c-library) <webcpp-c-library>ctaes <conditional>@c-library-checked-out
    <include>libs/ctaes/src/crypto/ctaes
  : : <include>libs/ctaes/src/crypto/ctaes <define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_HAS_CTAES=1 $(.gc) ;
explicit ctaes ;
```

  `canary_ctaes.c` is the prototype's (configuration `default`), with
  `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_CTAES_COMMIT 9be056a` in `detail/canary.h` beside the others, under its
  `_CANARY_COMMIT` seam.
- [ ] **Step 4: Write `backends/ctaes.hpp`:**

  `gcm<aes256<backends::ctaes>>` refuses where it is instantiated, as a member's type, so
  that the class does not compile (spec 2.4); `aes256<backends::ctaes>` stays complete.
  `include/webcpp/crypto.hpp` gains `backends/ctaes.hpp` under `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_HAS_CTAES`.
  The engine's in-place call passes the same pointer as input and output: the test's FIPS
  and AESAVS cases pin it on every target.
- [ ] **Step 5: ctaes's own test** (spec 8.1): in `test/c_suites/Jamfile`,
  `webcpp.run ctaes_test : $(CTAES)/test.c : <library>/third_party//ctaes <warnings>off <warnings-as-errors>off ;`
  with `path-constant CTAES : ../../../../third_party/libs/ctaes/src/crypto/ctaes ;`, in the
  lane `c-suites` and also in the ordinary lanes (spec 8's table puts ctaes's `test.c` on the
  fast set): it is declared a second time outside the lane as `ctaes_test_fast`.
- [ ] **Step 6: The rest of increment 2's cases:**
  - `test/unused/Jamfile`: `webcpp.same-program unused_ctaes : app.cpp : /third_party//ctaes : : <library>/webcpp/crypto//crypto ;`;
  - `test/sizes/wasm/Jamfile` and `test/sizes/native/Jamfile`: `sign.cpp` (spec 7.4's
    program, in `test/sizes/`) linked with `<webcpp-secp256k1-tables>small` and `large`, at
    both optimisations, in each `sizes.json` and its `--expect` list; the
    table regenerated (Task 22, Step 3);
  - the user's Jamfiles of spec 7.4 and 7.5, fixtures of Task 10's test, each with its
    outcome: `sign` (`exe sign : sign.cpp /webcpp/crypto//crypto /third_party//secp256k1 ;`,
    `targets: native wasip2 wasip3 emscripten`, `schnorr ok`), `sign_small` (the same with `: <webcpp-secp256k1-tables>small ;`),
    `encrypt_and_sign` (`exe app : app.cpp /webcpp/crypto//crypto /third_party//bearssl /third_party//secp256k1 ;`,
    a program that seals and signs, printing `aes256_gcm ok backend=bearssl` and
    `schnorr ok`), `block` (`exe block : block.cpp /webcpp/crypto//crypto /third_party//ctaes ;`,
    `ctaes aes256 ok`), and `msvc_gcm_on_ctaes` (Task 18's form for spec 2.4's assertion);
    each of their programs also compiled in `test/Jamfile` (Task 24's `doc_*` lines, m21);
    the canary cases of Task 18 for libsecp256k1 (missing; other configuration with
    `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_SECP256K1_CANARY_CONFIGURATION=w2c2x5` against the large tables, the
    case CR-REVIEW M12 named) and ctaes (missing), each linker's lines as Task 18 measured them;
  - the documentation: `doc/secp256k1.adoc` (spec 2.8 for a user: the shape, the context in
    the user's resource and its randomisation, the static context and its self-test,
    `ecdh`'s secret, high-S refused, every error, the whole C API reachable, one copy per
    program), `doc/block.adoc` completed with ctaes, `doc/jamfile.adoc` with 7.4 and 7.5,
    `doc/backends.adoc` with ctaes and libsecp256k1 (their tables, licences, allocation:
    none, and the signing context in the user's resource).
- [ ] **Step 7: Run** the four lanes, the own lanes `c-suites` and `sizes` on their targets,
  `constant-time` on a Linux machine (Task 20's Step 5), `python3 tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py`
  and the doc. Expected: PASS.
- [ ] **Step 8: Commit** (superproject) `"third_party: ctaes, as Bitcoin Core v31.1 ships it"`;
  (library) `"crypto: the AES block cipher on ctaes, GCM refused on it, and increment 2's
  pages"`.

## Task 30: Increment 2 whole: green, review

- [ ] **Step 1: Run the definition of green** as Task 25's Step 2, with the new lanes' programs.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Dispatch the review of increment 2, with the Review Focus and spec sections
  2.3, 2.8, 3.4, 3.5, 8.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Fix what it finds, each with a failing test first; then G4's push of the
  library and the superproject, with the owner's agreement.

# Increment 3: trystero's migration

trystero is changed in its own repository, `libs/trystero`, on a branch `crypto` of it
(made in the precondition below, from trystero's `main` after the shared-connection track),
and its commits are `trystero: <what>`. Every
test of trystero passes before each commit: its four lanes (native, gcc-15, emscripten, and
the own lanes `oracle` and `interop`, the second with Chrome), as its AGENTS.md lists them.

**Precondition (I17): trystero's shared-connection track has integrated.** That track
(`~/.buzz/PLANS/WEBCPP_TRYSTERO_SHARED_SPEC.md`, approved in advance, DESIGN 2026-10-11
"three documents approved in advance"; its plan `~/.buzz/PLANS/WEBCPP_TRYSTERO_SHARED_PLAN.md`,
worktree `~/dev/webcpp-trystero-shared`, superproject branch `trystero-shared`, trystero's
branch `shared-connection`) moves connections, self ids and negotiations from the room to an
`app`, in `room.hpp`, `signaling.hpp` and the backend interface, which this increment changes
too. It goes first ("The base, the order of the tracks, and the rebase points", point 5).
Before Task 31 starts:
1. `git -C ~/dev/webcpp log --oneline -1 main` shows the superproject's integration of that
   track (its plan's last task), and `git -C libs/trystero merge-base --is-ancestor
   origin/main HEAD` holds after `git -C libs/trystero fetch origin`; if the track has not
   integrated, this increment waits, and the ledger says so (increments 4 and 5 do not
   depend on it and may go first).
2. This worktree rebases onto `main`
   (`git -c user.name=R -c user.email=github.overboard312@passmail.net rebase main`, then
   `git submodule update --init libs/trystero`), runs the identity check of "The base, the
   order of the tracks", point 3, here and in `libs/trystero` (expected `identity: ok` in both, no
   `stop` line), and the branch `crypto` of trystero is made from trystero's `main` after the
   rebase (`git -C libs/trystero switch -c crypto origin/main`).
3. Task 31's Step 4 table of call sites is re-read against the rebased files: each row names
   today's function (`room.hpp`'s `start()` and `random_id`, `signaling.hpp`'s seal and open
   and `make_id`, `backend::factory`'s `make_sealer` and `random`), and each is mapped to
   where the track put it (the `app`, a connection, the room) by `git grep -n` of the row's
   call (`make_sealer(`, `random(`, `make_id(`) in `libs/trystero/include`; the table is
   rewritten with the new places before Step 4 runs, and a row whose call the track
   removed is struck with the reason. The ledger records the base's commit and the
   rewritten table.

## Task 31: trystero seals with `aes256_gcm` directly, and draws from `random_device`

**Files (in `libs/trystero`):**
- Create: `include/webcpp/trystero/detail/sealer.hpp`, `test/sealer_test.cpp`.
- Delete: `include/webcpp/trystero/native/sealer.hpp`, `test/native_sealer_test.cpp`,
  `test/browser_sealer_test.cpp`.
- Modify: `include/webcpp/trystero/backend.hpp` (no `sealer`, no `make_sealer`; `random`
  returns a result), `include/webcpp/trystero/native/backend.hpp`,
  `include/webcpp/trystero/browser/backend.hpp` (its `sealer` class removed, `random` on
  `random_device`), `include/webcpp/trystero/room.hpp`,
  `include/webcpp/trystero/detail/signaling.hpp`,
  `include/webcpp/trystero/detail/nostr_strategy.hpp`, `test/support/memory_backend.hpp`
  (no `memory_sealer`; `random` with a failure seam), `test/Jamfile`,
  `test/CONVERSION.md`, `build.jam`, `doc/native.adoc`, `doc/browser.adoc`,
  `doc/design.adoc`, `doc/allocation.adoc`, `doc/testing.adoc`, `doc/overview.adoc`,
  `doc/guarantees.adoc`.
- Modify (superproject): `tools/test/third_party_test.py` (the link-line case of Step 5, I14).

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `webcpp::crypto::aes256_gcm`, `webcpp::crypto::random_device`.
- Produces: `class webcpp::trystero::detail::sealer` with
  `static boost::system::result<sealer> make(std::array<std::uint8_t, 32> key, backend::factory& factory, std::pmr::memory_resource* memory)`,
  `boost::system::result<std::pmr::string> seal(std::string_view plaintext)`,
  `boost::system::result<std::pmr::string> open(std::string_view sealed)`;
  `virtual boost::system::result<void> backend::factory::random(std::span<std::uint8_t> out) = 0;`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** `test/sealer_test.cpp`, on the memory backend's
  factory (seeded), on native and emscripten (trystero's targets): a text sealed under a
  room key opens to itself; the sealed form is Trystero's (`protocol::parse_sealed` reads a
  16-byte IV and the ciphertext with its 16-byte tag); a text sealed under another key, a
  changed byte, a text that is not a sealed text and an IV of another size give
  `trystero::error::wrong_password` (what `open` reported before); a vector sealed by
  Trystero's JavaScript (the one `native_sealer_test.cpp` held, moved here) opens; a factory
  whose `random` fails makes `seal` fail with `webcpp::crypto::error::entropy_unavailable`.
  The two deleted tests' cases are each carried here or named in `CONVERSION.md` as
  replaced, case by case (AGENTS chapter 9, "a test moved ... records the conversion"). In
  `test/Jamfile`, `webcpp.run sealer : sealer_test.cpp ;` and its `_no_exceptions` twin, in
  place of `native_sealer` and `browser_sealer` and their twins. Run trystero's native lane.
  Expected: FAIL, `detail/sealer.hpp` not found.
- [ ] **Step 2: Write `detail/sealer.hpp`:**

```

  `open` keeps what trystero reported before for every failure, `wrong_password`, as
  Trystero's `decrypt` does: an IV of any length from 1 to 128 bytes opens (crypto's cap); a
  longer or empty one is `invalid_iv_size` from crypto, which `open` reports as
  `wrong_password`, with a case in the test.
- [ ] **Step 3: Change the backend interface.** In `backend.hpp`, the class `sealer` and
  `factory::make_sealer` go, with their Doc Comments, and `random` becomes:

```cpp
    /**
     * Fills `out` with bytes from a cryptographically secure source: they become secret keys,
     * ids and IVs.
     *
     * @param out The bytes to fill.
     * @return Nothing, or why the source failed (`webcpp::crypto::error::entropy_unavailable`),
     * which fails the operation that needed the bytes.
     */
    virtual boost::system::result<void> random(std::span<std::uint8_t> out) = 0;
```

  The native backend's `random` and `make_sealer` become:

```cpp
    /**
     * Fills `out` from the system's generator, through webcpp::crypto's random device.
     *
     * @param out The bytes to fill.
     * @return Nothing, or `webcpp::crypto::error::entropy_unavailable`.
     */
    boost::system::result<void> random(std::span<std::uint8_t> out) override {
        return webcpp::crypto::random_device().fill(out);  // lint-world: Trystero's randomness
    }
```

  (and `#include <webcpp/crypto/random_device.hpp>  // lint-world: Trystero's randomness`;
  `#include <openssl/rand.h>` and `std::abort` go); the browser backend's `random` is the
  same line, its loop over `getentropy` and its `#include <sys/random.h>` gone (the result
  was ignored there, spec 6), and its class `sealer`, with `make_sealer`, goes. The memory
  backend's `random` returns `{}` after its seeded bytes, unless the test set
  `fail_random = true`, a member of `memory_network`, when it returns
  `webcpp::crypto::error::entropy_unavailable`.
- [ ] **Step 4: Change the call sites**, each failure reported through the room's errors:

| Call site | Today | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `room.hpp`, `start()`: `sealer_ = factory_.make_sealer(...)` | an asynchronous sealer of the backend's | `auto made = detail::sealer::make(protocol::seal_key(...), factory_, memory_);` then, on error, `report("", made.error(), "the room's sealer could not be made");` and the join stops there (no wire, no signaling); else `sealer_ = std::allocate_shared<detail::sealer>(allocator(), std::move(*made));` |
| `room.hpp`, `random_id(n)` | ignores the source's failure | returns `boost::system::result<std::pmr::string>`; its callers (the self id when the configuration has none, an action's transfer id) report `entropy_unavailable` through `report("", ec, "no entropy for an id")` and fail what needed it: a join, a send (its completion gets the error) |
| `signaling.hpp`, `make_id(n)` | the same | the same change: an offer that cannot get an id is not made, and the negotiation with that peer is reported failed through `cb_.failed` (the callback the room gives signaling for a failed negotiation) with the error |
| `signaling.hpp`, `sealer_->seal(sdp, <completion>)` (offer, answer, candidate) | posted completion `on_*_sealed(ec, sealed)` | `auto const sealed = sealer_->seal(sdp);` then the same `on_*_sealed(peer, pc, sealed ? boost::system::error_code{} : sealed.error(), sealed ? std::string_view(*sealed) : std::string_view())` called directly, at the end of the function, where the completion was posted |
| `signaling.hpp`, `sealer_->open(text, <completion>)` (offer, answer, candidate) | posted completion `on_*_opened(ec, plaintext)` | the same, with `open` |
| `nostr_strategy.hpp`, `make_signer` | loops on `factory.random` until a key | Task 32 |
| `nostr_strategy.hpp`, `make_subscription_id` | ignores failure | returns a result; a relay that cannot subscribe is reported through the strategy's log and `report` with the error, and retried as a lost relay is |
| `nostr_strategy.hpp`, `event_for` (aux) | ignores failure | returns a result; an event that cannot get its auxiliary randomness is not published, and the failure is reported |
| `nostr_strategy.hpp`, the reconnect's jitter | ignores failure | on failure the reconnect waits the whole `retry_ms`, which needs no randomness, and the failure is reported |

  The `on_*_sealed` and `on_*_opened` functions keep their checks (`find(peer)`, the
  connection's identity), which a direct call needs as the posted one did: they read the
  state again after the call. The direct calls change one guarantee of the old backend
  interface, "a handler never runs inside the call that started it"; none of these functions
  is a user's handler, and the test of Step 6 runs the room's whole negotiation, both
  directions, on the memory backend.
- [ ] **Step 5: Name the libraries** in trystero's `build.jam`: the alias `trystero` gains
  `<library>/webcpp/crypto//crypto <library>/third_party//bearssl` in its usage requirements
  (BearSSL on every target: in the browser it is the backend, natively the default only
  without OpenSSL); the alias `native` gains `<library>/third_party//openssl` in place of its
  `<library>ssl <library>crypto` (OpenSSL is then the default natively, spec 5). That target
  is libssl and libcrypto as one choice, shared or static by
  `<webcpp-crypto-openssl-link>` (Task 11, I14), so Beast's TLS and libdatachannel's DTLS
  take libssl from it too, and a program holds one libcrypto whichever link it chose (spec
  3.7, "a process with two copies of libcrypto ... has two hooks"). trystero's own OpenSSL
  goes whole: both `lib ssl` and both `lib crypto` alternatives, the line
  `local openssl-root = [ webcpp.external trystero : OpenSSL ... ]`, and `OpenSSL` in
  `native-dependencies`' `webcpp.external-found` (the stop a user meets is then
  `/third_party//openssl`'s, Task 11's text, and a test of trystero's that pinned its own
  stop pins that one). `test/Jamfile`'s headers-alone call that named
  `trystero/native/sealer.hpp` drops it. A case of `tools/test/third_party_test.py` (the
  superproject's, in this increment's superproject commit) builds a program of
  `/webcpp/trystero//native` with `-d+2` once per link and asserts that its link line names
  libssl and libcrypto once each, both static (`.a`, or `libssl.lib` from the static
  directory with MSVC) with `static` and both shared with `shared`; written first, it fails
  on today's `build.jam` (a shared `-lssl` beside the static libcrypto).
- [ ] **Step 6: Run** trystero's lanes: native (Apple clang), gcc-15, emscripten, and the own
  lanes `oracle` and `interop` (native and in Chrome against Trystero's JavaScript, which
  proves the sealed texts are Trystero's). Expected: PASS, every test, the interop's
  handshakes included.
- [ ] **Step 7: Write the documentation:** `doc/native.adoc` and `doc/browser.adoc` (the sealer
  is webcpp::crypto's `aes256_gcm`, the backends' randomness `random_device`), `doc/design.adoc`
  (the factory makes no sealer), `doc/allocation.adoc` (the sealer allocates its texts in the
  room's resource; OpenSSL's `make` allocates outside it, the departure crypto states),
  `doc/guarantees.adoc` and `doc/testing.adoc` (`sealer` in place of the two tests), and the
  change of behaviour: natively, a machine without entropy no longer aborts; the operation
  that needed the bytes fails with `entropy_unavailable` (spec 9, increment 3).
- [ ] **Step 8: Commit** (trystero) `"trystero: AES-GCM through webcpp::crypto, a direct call,
  and randomness that reports its failure"`; (superproject)
  `"tools/test: trystero's OpenSSL is one choice of libssl and libcrypto"`.

## Task 32: trystero signs with `secp256k1::keypair`, and libsecp256k1 comes from `third_party`

**Files (in `libs/trystero`):**
- Modify: `include/webcpp/trystero/protocol/nostr.hpp` (`signer`, `verify`),
  `include/webcpp/trystero/detail/nostr_strategy.hpp` (`make_signer`), `build.jam`,
  `test/Jamfile`, `test/protocol_test.cpp`, `doc/building.adoc`, `doc/native.adoc`,
  `README.md`.
- Modify (superproject): `tools/ci/matrix.py` (`EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCIES`,
  `EXTERNAL_VARIABLES`), `tools/ci/matrix_test.py`, `.github/workflows/library.yml` (the
  `secp256k1` steps), `tools/ci/actions_test.py`; delete `tools/ci/actions/secp256k1/` when no
  other library needs it (none does).

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `webcpp::crypto::secp256k1::keypair`, `verify_schnorr`.
- Produces: `protocol::nostr::signer` unchanged in shape for its callers, over a `keypair`;
  `static boost::system::result<signer> signer::from_secret(std::span<std::uint8_t const, 32>, std::pmr::memory_resource*)`
  (it returned `std::optional`); `verify` unchanged.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** in `test/protocol_test.cpp`: `signer::from_secret` of
  a zero secret gives `webcpp::crypto::error::invalid_secret_key`; a signature of a known key
  and event id, with zero auxiliary randomness, equals BIP340's (row 0 of
  `bip-0340/test-vectors.csv`: secret `00...03`, message `00...00`, aux `00...00`, signature
  `e907831f80848d1069a5371b402410364bdf1c5f8307b0084c55f1ce2dca821525f66a4a85ea8b71e482a74f382d2ce5ebeee8fdb2172f477df4900d310536c0`);
  `verify` of it is true, of a changed id false. Run. Expected: FAIL to compile,
  `from_secret` returns an optional.
- [ ] **Step 2: Move `signer` and `verify` onto crypto** (spec 9, increment 3):

```cpp
class signer {
public:
    /**
     * Makes a key from 32 random bytes.
     *
     * @param secret The secret key.
     * @param memory The resource the signing context and the public key's text are allocated in;
     * it must outlive the signer.
     * @return The signer; `webcpp::crypto::error::invalid_secret_key` when the bytes are not a
     * valid secret key, which is negligibly rare; `entropy_unavailable` when the context's
     * randomisation finds no entropy.
     */
    static boost::system::result<signer> from_secret(
        std::span<const std::uint8_t, 32> secret,
        std::pmr::memory_resource* memory = std::pmr::get_default_resource()) {
        auto key = webcpp::crypto::secp256k1::keypair::make(secret, memory);
        if (!key) {
            return key.error();
        }
        auto const xonly = key->xonly_public_key();
        return signer(std::move(*key), to_hex(*xonly, memory));
    }

    [[nodiscard]] std::string_view pubkey() const { return pubkey_; }

    [[nodiscard]] std::array<std::uint8_t, 64> sign(std::span<const std::uint8_t, 32> message,
                                                    std::span<const std::uint8_t, 32> aux) const {
        return *key_.sign_schnorr(message, aux);
    }

private:
    signer(webcpp::crypto::secp256k1::keypair key, std::pmr::string pubkey)
        : key_(std::move(key)), pubkey_(std::move(pubkey)) {}

    webcpp::crypto::secp256k1::keypair key_;
    std::pmr::string pubkey_;
};

inline bool verify(std::span<const std::uint8_t, 64> sig, std::span<const std::uint8_t, 32> id,
                   std::span<const std::uint8_t, 32> pubkey) {
    return webcpp::crypto::secp256k1::verify_schnorr(sig, id, pubkey).has_value();
}
```

  with each member's Doc Comment kept from today's, `sign` saying that a key pair made by
  `from_secret` always signs (a moved-from signer is the only `invalid_state`, and trystero
  never signs with one). `make_signer` in `nostr_strategy.hpp` returns
  `boost::system::result<protocol::nostr::signer>`: it draws 32 bytes (a failure is
  returned), retries on `invalid_secret_key`, returns any other error; the strategy's
  creation, and so the room's join, fails with it, reported as Task 31's join failures are.
  `#include <secp256k1*.h>` lines go from `nostr.hpp`.
- [ ] **Step 3: Name the library** (spec 4.5, one copy per program): trystero's `build.jam`
  loses `secp256k1-root`, `secp256k1-emscripten-root`, the three `lib secp256k1`
  alternatives and `trystero-dependencies`' check of them; the alias `trystero` gains
  `<library>/third_party//secp256k1`. In the superproject, `EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCIES` becomes
  `{'trystero': ('libdatachannel', 'openssl'), 'crypto': ('openssl',)}` and
  `EXTERNAL_VARIABLES` loses `SECP256K1_ROOT` and `SECP256K1_EMSCRIPTEN_ROOT`; the workflow's
  two `secp256k1` steps and `tools/ci/actions/secp256k1/` go, with their cases in
  `tools/ci/actions_test.py`; AGENTS.md chapter 1's prerequisites and `.local` table lose
  `secp256k1-native` and `secp256k1-emscripten`.
- [ ] **Step 4: Run** trystero's lanes, as Task 31's Step 6, then
  `python3 tools/ci/matrix_test.py`, `python3 tools/ci/actions_test.py` and the lint.
  Expected: PASS; `lint: clean`.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit** (trystero) `"trystero: Nostr's signatures on webcpp::crypto's
  secp256k1, libsecp256k1 from third_party"`; (superproject) `"tools/ci: libsecp256k1 is no
  external library any more"`.

## Task 33: The memory option beside Boost.Asio's SSL, libdatachannel and a TLS handshake

**Files (in `libs/trystero`):**
- Create: `test/openssl_memory/Jamfile`, `test/openssl_memory/neighbours_test.cpp`,
  `test/openssl_memory/handshake_test.cpp`.
- Modify: `test/Jamfile` (`build-project openssl_memory ;`).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the tests** (spec 8.5, "Its neighbours in the process"), each over
  crypto's `support.hpp` (`#include "../../../crypto/test/openssl_memory/support.hpp"`,
  whose counting resource, exit check and interposers they share, so that both libraries'
  tests check the option the same way):
  - `neighbours_test.cpp`: includes `<boost/asio/ssl.hpp>` and libdatachannel's `<rtc/rtc.hpp>`,
    and touches one symbol of each so the linker keeps them (`boost::asio::ssl::context` is
    not constructed; `rtc::InitLogger` is not called: their address is taken into a
    volatile pointer); `main`'s first statement is `install_memory_functions()`, which must
    succeed: neither library used OpenSSL during static initialisation; then the exit check;
  - `handshake_test.cpp`: installs, then runs a TLS 1.3 handshake through libssl in one
    process over a pair of memory BIOs (`BIO_new_bio_pair`): a server whose key and
    self-signed certificate it makes at run time (`EVP_PKEY_Q_keygen(nullptr, nullptr, "EC", "P-256")`,
    `X509_new`, `X509_set_pubkey`, `X509_sign`), a client that does not verify, both stepped
    with `SSL_do_handshake` until both finish, one application record each way, then the
    `SSL`, `SSL_CTX`, key and certificate freed; it passes when the handshake finished, no
    foreign block was freed through the adapter, the C library's allocator was called 0 times
    while it ran (the interposers), and the exit check holds. A pair of memory BIOs stands for
    the loopback socket of spec 8.5: libssl's allocations are the same and the container lane
    needs no socket.
  `test/openssl_memory/Jamfile`: `project : requirements <library>/webcpp/trystero//native <exception-handling>on <define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_OPENSSL_MEMORY_RESOURCE ;`
  (the native backend needs exceptions, trystero's rule), `webcpp.targets native ;`, the
  counter's sources by `<target-os>` as crypto's Jamfile names them (by path into
  `libs/crypto/test/openssl_memory/`), and `webcpp.run neighbours` and `webcpp.run handshake`,
  each also `<webcpp-crypto-openssl-link>static` as a twin. The static twins link libssl
  statically too, since `/webcpp/trystero//native` takes both from `/third_party//openssl`
  (Task 31's Step 5, I14): the handshake's libssl then calls the one libcrypto whose memory
  functions the test installed, and a shared libssl, which would bring a second libcrypto
  outside the adapter, cannot be linked by these Jamfiles (Task 31's link-line case is the
  check).
- [ ] **Step 2: Run** trystero's native lane and gcc-15's. Expected: PASS, both programs and
  their static twins.
- [ ] **Step 3: Commit** (trystero) `"trystero: OpenSSL's memory option beside Asio's SSL,
  libdatachannel and a TLS handshake"`.

## Task 34: Increment 3 whole: green, review, the gates

- [ ] **Step 1: Run the definition of green**: crypto's lanes and own lanes (Task 25's list),
  trystero's lanes and own lanes, the lint, the doc (`$B2 -a --build-dir=bin/b-doc doc`), the
  tools' tests touched.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Dispatch the review of increment 3 (trystero's branch, crypto's changes,
  the superproject's), with the Review Focus and spec section 9's increment 3.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Fix what it finds, each with a failing test first.
- [ ] **Step 4 (controller, G4):** with the owner's agreement, push crypto, trystero (merged
  into its `main` by the owner), then the superproject with both submodules moved.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `detail::chacha_state`, `detail::chacha_engine` (declared in Task 6).
- Produces: `webcpp::crypto::chacha20_poly1305<Backend>` (spec 2.5); the ChaCha engine
  contract:

```cpp
template <> struct chacha_engine<B> {
    static boost::system::result<void> init(chacha_state<B>&, std::span<std::uint8_t const> key) noexcept;
    static boost::system::result<void> seal(chacha_state<B>&, std::span<std::uint8_t const> iv,

  Each backend's test file calls `check_rfc8439` and `check_chacha_guards_and_tampering`; the
  Wycheproof files `check_wycheproof_chacha`; `agreement_chacha_test.cpp` calls
  `agree_chacha<bearssl, openssl>(20261011)`. In `test/Jamfile` the BearSSL ones on every
  target, the OpenSSL ones natively, the Wycheproof ones with
  `<library>/third_party//wycheproof <library>/webcpp//boost_json`, the agreement natively.
  The message case `chacha_on_ctaes` states
  `webcpp::crypto: chacha20_poly1305<backends::ctaes>: ctaes exports the AES block cipher alone. Use a backend that exports ChaCha20-Poly1305: chacha20_poly1305<backends::bearssl>, chacha20_poly1305<backends::openssl> or chacha20_poly1305<backends::botan>.`

```

  The GCM engine's `start`, `run`, `tag` and `check` take a state that only names the
  context, so ChaCha's borrows them on its own context: the controls they send are the AEAD
  ones under GCM's names. ctaes's refusal, in `backends/ctaes.hpp`:

```cpp
template <class Backend>
    requires std::is_same_v<Backend, backends::ctaes>
struct chacha_state<Backend> {
    static_assert(!std::is_same_v<Backend, backends::ctaes>, "webcpp::crypto: chacha20_poly1305<backends::ctaes>: ctaes exports the AES block cipher alone. Use a backend that exports ChaCha20-Poly1305: chacha20_poly1305<backends::bearssl>, chacha20_poly1305<backends::openssl> or chacha20_poly1305<backends::botan>.");
};
```

  A partial specialisation constrained to ctaes, so that its assertion depends on the
  template's parameter and fires only when `chacha20_poly1305<backends::ctaes>` is
  instantiated (a full specialisation's assertion would fire wherever the header is
  included); `<type_traits>` joins the header's includes. `include/webcpp/crypto.hpp` includes
  `chacha20_poly1305.hpp` (no backend) beside `gcm.hpp`.
- [ ] **Step 4: Extend the other lanes' tests**, each case written first and seen failing
  (no `chacha20_poly1305.hpp` before Step 2, or no engine before Step 3):
  - allocation (BearSSL: nothing; OpenSSL: the messages nothing, `make` reported), through
    Task 17's `counting.hpp`, the C library's allocator counted where the target lets it be;
  - the memory option's `everything_test.cpp` (spec 8.5: "The parts on chacha20_poly1305
    land with it");
  - OpenSSL's error queue (spec 3.3, m14): `openssl_error_queue_test.cpp`'s `main` becomes
    a function template `check_queue<Aead>(key, iv)` over the AEAD, run for
    `gcm<aes256<openssl>>` (12-byte IV) and `chacha20_poly1305<openssl>` (32-byte key,
    12-byte nonce): for each, the caller's `ERR_raise` entry survives a make, a seal, a good
    open and a failed one, and nothing of webcpp's is left beside it (one entry, the
    caller's);
  - `ctgrind_test.cpp` (seal and open of ChaCha20-Poly1305 on BearSSL; seal on OpenSSL, as
    Task 20 does for GCM, since OpenSSL's tag check cannot be declassified, I8): BearSSL's
    open branches only on the verdict of `equal`, declassified by the engine (Step 3), so
    memcheck reports nothing; the planted leak still fails as Task 20's;
  - `msan_test.cpp` the same cases on BearSSL;
  - `dudect_test.cpp` (m14), Task 20's form for ChaCha20-Poly1305 on BearSSL natively and on
    wasip2: a seal whose two classes draw the same random bytes and select by class (a zero
    key against random ones, m7), and an open whose two classes both fail (the right tag
    with its last byte flipped against random wrong tags, I9), each through `twice` under
    the threshold 10;
  - the sizes (`chacha_bearssl.cpp`, both optimisations, in `test/sizes/wasm/Jamfile` and
    `test/sizes/native/Jamfile` with their `--expect` lists);
  - the MSVC case of the refusal (the fixture `msvc_chacha_on_ctaes`).
- [ ] **Step 5: Run** the four lanes, the own lanes `constant-time` and `sizes`, and
  `python3 tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py msvc_chacha_on_ctaes`; regenerate
  `doc/sizes.adoc`. Expected: PASS: RFC 8439's two vectors and Wycheproof's 325
  on both backends, the agreement, the refusal.
- [ ] **Step 6: Write the documentation:** `doc/aead.adoc` gains ChaCha20-Poly1305 (spec 2.5:
  one shot, exactly 12-byte nonces, the limit, nonces never repeated and the 2^32 with random
  ones, the backends), `doc/backends.adoc` and `doc/jamfile.adoc` their rows and the new
  message.
- [ ] **Step 7: Commit:** `"crypto: ChaCha20-Poly1305 on BearSSL and OpenSSL, against RFC
  8439 and Wycheproof"`.

## Task 36: Increment 4 whole: green, review, push

- [ ] **Step 1:** The definition of green, as Task 25's Step 2.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Review of increment 4 (spec 2.5, 8.1's ChaCha part, 8.2, 8.5's ChaCha part),
  with the Review Focus; fixes, each with a failing test first.
- [ ] **Step 3 (G4):** push the library and the superproject, with the owner's agreement.

# Increment 5: Botan, native, with exceptions

## Task 37: Botan found, or the build stops

**Files (superproject):**
- Create: `tools/ci/actions/botan/action.yml`, `tools/ci/actions/botan/install.sh`.
- Modify: `third_party/Jamfile` (the feature and the target), `tools/ci/matrix.py`
  (`EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCIES['crypto'] = ('openssl', 'botan')`, `EXTERNAL_VARIABLES` gains
  `BOTAN_ROOT`), `tools/ci/matrix_test.py`, `tools/ci/actions_test.py`,
  `.github/workflows/library.yml` (the step `botan`, on its name, natively).
- Modify (library): `build.jam` (the declaration).
- Create (superproject): Botan's stop cases, fixtures of Task 10's test under
  `tools/test/fixtures/crypto_jamfiles/botan_*/`.

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `/third_party//botan` (usage requirements: Botan's include directory
  `include/botan-3`, `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_HAS_BOTAN=1`, the section garbage collection); the feature
  `webcpp-crypto-botan-link` (`shared`, `static`, propagated); `.local/botan` laid out by the
  action.

- [ ] **Step 1: Measure where Botan 3 comes from on each runner**, in the action's first run
  (the measurement decides the action's branches, each kept only if measured):
  - macOS: Homebrew's `botan` (3.13.0 on 2026-10-11, M6), linked into `.local/botan` as the
    OpenSSL action links `openssl@3`;
  - Linux: `pkg-config --modversion botan-3` on the runner (ubuntu-24.04 and 26.04); when it
    answers a 3.x, the system's, linked; when it does not, Botan 3.13.0 built from its release
    archive, `https://botan.randombit.net/releases/Botan-3.13.0.tar.xz`, checked with
    `tools/ci/download.sh` against
    `12f5a8358890bbee82edfe9d2e7769b0a610b6dd0e0698aea13d20a675d84620` (M6), configured with
    `python3 configure.py --prefix="$PWD/.local/botan" --minimized-build --enable-modules=aes,gcm,chacha20poly1305 --without-documentation`
    (the modules webcpp's backend needs; `configure.py` adds what they require), built with
    `make -j"$(nproc)" install`, and cached by `actions/cache` (pinned as `library.yml` pins
    its third-party actions) under a key of the archive's SHA-256, the runner's OS and the
    compiler;
  - Windows: the same archive built with MSVC (`python configure.py --cc=msvc --os=windows ...`
    then `nmake install`), cached the same way.
  The container lanes use the host's `.local/botan`, as they use `.local/openssl`: the
  container mounts the superproject at its own path.
- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing build cases** (spec 3.6, 4.4, 8.6), fixtures of Task 10's
  test: `botan_on_wasm` (`targets: wasip2 wasip3 emscripten`:
  `error: /third_party//botan: Botan is a native backend, and this build is for WebAssembly. In the program's Jamfile, name /third_party//bearssl in its place.`),
  `botan_not_found` (native, with Task 11's knobs:
  `error: /third_party//botan: the program names Botan, and it was not found: ` and
  `. Install it (apt install libbotan-3-dev; brew install botan, then give -sBOTAN_ROOT=<the directory that brew --prefix botan prints>), give -sBOTAN_ROOT=<dir>, the directory of its include/ and lib/, or name /third_party//bearssl or /third_party//openssl in its place.`),
  `botan_wrong_root` (`holds no include/botan-3/botan/aead.h`), `botan_static_missing`
  (Task 11's form). Run the lane. Expected: FAIL, no target `botan`.
- [ ] **Step 3: Write the target**, Task 11's form for Botan: in crypto's `build.jam`,
  `webcpp.external crypto : Botan : BOTAN_ROOT : botan : botan-3/botan/aead.h : native ;`; in
  `third_party/Jamfile`:

  Botan's MSVC library names are the ones its `configure.py` writes (`botan-3.lib` for both
  links in an MSVC build of 3.x, the shared one an import library beside `botan-3.dll`):
  the first Windows run of the action lists `lib/` in its log, and the Jamfile follows what it
  lists.
- [ ] **Step 4: Write the action**, `tools/ci/actions/botan/install.sh` with the branches Step
  1 kept, in the OpenSSL action's form (its `refuse`, its `link`, `BOTAN_ROOT` written to
  `GITHUB_ENV`), and its case in `tools/ci/actions_test.py` (a fake Linux prefix with a
  `botan-3.pc` is linked). Run `python3 tools/ci/actions_test.py` and
  `python3 tools/ci/matrix_test.py` (crypto's native lanes list `["botan", "openssl"]`).
  Expected: PASS.
- [ ] **Step 5: Run** `python3 tools/test/crypto_jamfiles_test.py botan_on_wasm botan_not_found botan_wrong_root botan_static_missing`
  once Homebrew's `botan` is installed and linked into `.local/botan` (the action's macOS
  branch; `brew install botan`, the one machine-wide change of this plan, departure 4, which
  the owner agrees to first). Expected: `crypto_jamfiles_test: ok`.
- [ ] **Step 6: Commit** (superproject) `"third_party: Botan 3 found, natively, or the build
  stops; tools/ci: Botan's action"`; (library) `"crypto: Botan declared, and its stops as a
  user meets them"`.

## Task 38: The Botan backend, with exceptions only

**Files:**
- Create: `include/webcpp/crypto/backends/botan.hpp`, `test/botan/Jamfile`,
  `test/botan/gcm_botan_test.cpp`, `test/botan/chacha_botan_test.cpp`,
  `test/botan/aes_botan_test.cpp`, `test/botan/mapping_test.cpp`,
  `test/botan/additional_data_test.cpp`, `test/botan/allocation_botan_test.cpp`,
  `test/botan/headers_no_exceptions_test.cpp`, `test/messages/botan_*` (below).
- Modify: `include/webcpp/crypto/config.hpp` (Botan's refusals and its place in the default),
  `include/webcpp/crypto/aes256_gcm.hpp` (its include), `include/webcpp/crypto.hpp`,
  `test/Jamfile` (`build-project botan ;`), `test/messages/Jamfile`; (superproject)
  `tools/lint/compile_commands.py` and `tools/lint/lint_test.py` only if the lint's existing
  rule for a header that declares `<exception-handling>on` (AGENTS chapter 6) needs Botan's
  header named, which Step 6 checks.

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `struct webcpp::crypto::backends::botan { static constexpr std::string_view name = "botan"; };`
  (declared only with exceptions); the six traits for Botan; the macros
  `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DETAIL_DEFAULT_BOTAN`, `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_BOTAN`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing message tests** (spec 3.6, 4.3's new texts), each a
  directory of `test/messages/`:
  - `botan_on_wasm` (wasip2, wasip3; `<define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_HAS_BOTAN=1`):
    `webcpp::crypto: Botan is a native backend and this program is built for WebAssembly. In the program's Jamfile, replace /third_party//botan with /third_party//bearssl.`;
  - `botan_not_linked` (native; `<define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_BOTAN`, the source
    including `aes256_gcm.hpp`):
    `webcpp::crypto: the backend Botan is used and not linked. In the program's Jamfile, add /third_party//botan beside /webcpp/crypto//crypto; b2 links it when it finds Botan 3 (-sBOTAN_ROOT=<dir> names it). (without b2: define WEBCPP_CRYPTO_HAS_BOTAN=1 and link Botan 3)`;
  - `botan_without_exceptions` (native; `<define>WEBCPP_CRYPTO_HAS_BOTAN=1 <exception-handling>off`,
    Botan the only AEAD backend):
    `webcpp::crypto: the backend Botan needs exceptions, and this program is built without them. In the program's Jamfile, name /third_party//bearssl or /third_party//openssl in its place.`;
  - `default_openssl_and_botan`, `default_bearssl_and_botan` (native):
    `webcpp::crypto: both WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_OPENSSL and WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_BOTAN are defined. Keep one.`
    and the same with BEARSSL;
  - `default_botan_on_wasm` (wasip2):
    `webcpp::crypto: WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_BOTAN selects a native backend and this program is built for WebAssembly. Remove that define, or make it WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_BEARSSL.`;
  - `botan_old` (native; a fixture `include/botan-3/botan/build.h` defining
    `BOTAN_VERSION_MAJOR 2`):
    `webcpp::crypto: the backend Botan needs Botan 3, and the headers found are of another major version. Give -sBOTAN_ROOT=<dir>, the directory of Botan 3's include/ and lib/.`.
  Run the native and wasip2 lanes. Expected: FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 2: Extend `config.hpp`:** the refusals of Botan on WebAssembly (its `HAS` and its
  default), the two pairs of defaults with Botan, and the default's order natively
  `openssl`, `bearssl`, `botan`:

```cpp
#if defined(WEBCPP_CRYPTO_WEBASSEMBLY) && defined(WEBCPP_CRYPTO_HAS_BOTAN)
#error "webcpp::crypto: Botan is a native backend and this program is built for WebAssembly. In the program's Jamfile, replace /third_party//botan with /third_party//bearssl."
#endif
#if defined(WEBCPP_CRYPTO_WEBASSEMBLY) && defined(WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_BOTAN)
#error "webcpp::crypto: WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_BOTAN selects a native backend and this program is built for WebAssembly. Remove that define, or make it WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_BEARSSL."
#endif
#if defined(WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_OPENSSL) && defined(WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_BOTAN)
#error "webcpp::crypto: both WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_OPENSSL and WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_BOTAN are defined. Keep one."
#endif
#if defined(WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_BEARSSL) && defined(WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_BOTAN)
#error "webcpp::crypto: both WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_BEARSSL and WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_BOTAN are defined. Keep one."
#endif
```

  and the selection becomes, whole:

```cpp
#if defined(WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_OPENSSL)
#define WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DETAIL_DEFAULT_OPENSSL 1
#elif defined(WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_BEARSSL)
#define WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DETAIL_DEFAULT_BEARSSL 1
#elif defined(WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DEFAULT_BACKEND_BOTAN)
#define WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DETAIL_DEFAULT_BOTAN 1
#elif !defined(WEBCPP_CRYPTO_WEBASSEMBLY) && defined(WEBCPP_CRYPTO_HAS_OPENSSL)
#define WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DETAIL_DEFAULT_OPENSSL 1
#elif !defined(WEBCPP_CRYPTO_WEBASSEMBLY) && !defined(WEBCPP_CRYPTO_HAS_BEARSSL) && \
    defined(WEBCPP_CRYPTO_HAS_BOTAN)
#define WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DETAIL_DEFAULT_BOTAN 1
#else
#define WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DETAIL_DEFAULT_BEARSSL 1
#if !defined(WEBCPP_CRYPTO_HAS_BEARSSL)
#define WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DETAIL_NONE_LINKED 1
#endif
#endif
```

  (natively OpenSSL, then BearSSL, then Botan, spec 5), then
  `#if defined(WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DETAIL_DEFAULT_BOTAN) && defined(WEBCPP_CRYPTO_NO_EXCEPTIONS)`
  with the `botan_without_exceptions` text, and `default_backend` is `backends::botan` under
  `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_DETAIL_DEFAULT_BOTAN`. `aes256_gcm.hpp` includes `backends/botan.hpp` for that
  default, and its `detect_mismatch` value is `"botan"` there.
- [ ] **Step 3: Write `backends/botan.hpp`:** layer 1 (`botan_not_linked`'s text when
  `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_HAS_BOTAN` is not defined), then everything inside
  `#ifndef WEBCPP_CRYPTO_NO_EXCEPTIONS` with a comment naming Botan, which reports errors by
  throwing (AGENTS chapter 6's rule for a header that wraps a throwing dependency):

```cpp
#include <botan/aead.h>
#include <botan/block_cipher.h>
#include <botan/build.h>
#include <botan/exceptn.h>

  ChaCha20-Poly1305's update granularity in Botan 3 is 1 too (M6), so `process` takes the
  whole message and the scratch holds the tag alone. `Botan::Cipher_Mode::reset()` ends a
  message and keeps the key (Botan 3's `cipher_mode.h`); `clear()` wipes the key.
  `make` of a Botan
  object allocates (`create_or_throw`, `secure_vector`): the departure the owner accepted on
  2026-10-11, which `allocation_botan_test.cpp` counts and reports, and the backend's page
  states; every later call allocates nothing, which the same test proves with the counting
  `operator new` (Botan's `secure_allocator` goes to `calloc`, which the interposers of Task
  16 count: the test links them as Task 16's Jamfile does).
- [ ] **Step 4: Write the Botan tests** in `test/botan/` (its Jamfile:
  `project : requirements <library>/webcpp/crypto//crypto <library>/third_party//botan <exception-handling>on ;`
  with the reason in a comment, `webcpp.targets native ;`): the GCM checks of Tasks 7, 8 and
  9 on `botan` (spec cases, guards, tampering, moved-from, edges, incremental, machine, the
  one-shot during a message of Review Focus 1, limits, Wycheproof, CAVP), the block cipher's
  of Task 12, ChaCha's of Task 35; `mapping_test.cpp`, each mapping of `botan_call` by an
  exception thrown from a lambda given to it; `additional_data_test.cpp` (spec 3.6: a seal
  with additional data, then one without, compared with BearSSL's, so that the second
  message is not authenticated with the first's data); and
  `headers_no_exceptions_test.cpp`, a headers-alone compile of `backends/botan.hpp` with
  `<exception-handling>off` that only includes it (the header declares nothing then, AGENTS
  chapter 6), declared `webcpp.compile`, outside the Jamfile's project requirement through a
  directory of its own, `test/botan/no_exceptions/`.
- [ ] **Step 5: Run** the native lane (Apple clang) with `-sBOTAN_ROOT`, and the gcc-15 lane
  in its Linux container (`python3 tools/ci/matrix.py run gcc-15`, where the action's Botan is
  libstdc++'s). Expected: PASS. Then gcc-15 on the Mac itself, natively
  (`$B2 -a toolset=gcc-15 --build-dir=bin/lane-gcc-15-darwin libs/crypto/test`). Expected: the
  line `webcpp: crypto's programs of Botan are left out with gcc on macOS: ...` once, every
  Botan program skipped and the rest passing (I13: Homebrew's Botan is libc++'s, Task 37's
  rule).
- [ ] **Step 6: The lint.** Run it. A finding in `backends/botan.hpp` under the lint's
  no-exceptions twin is the case AGENTS chapter 6 names ("the lint leaves that header out of
  the analysis without exceptions, and names it"): the header's headers-alone call declares
  `<exception-handling>on`, which is what the lint reads; if the lint still analyses it
  without exceptions, `compile_commands.py`'s rule for that call is the fix, with its case in
  `lint_test.py`. Expected: `lint: clean`.
- [ ] **Step 7: Commit:** `"crypto: the Botan backend, with exceptions, its errors caught at
  its boundary, its additional data set on every message"`.

## Task 39: Botan in every native lane, its page, and the last green

**Files:**
- Create: `test/constant_time/ctgrind_botan_test.cpp`, `ctgrind_botan_planted_test.cpp`,
  `dudect_botan_test.cpp`.
- Modify: `test/support/agreement.hpp` (three-way), `test/botan/Jamfile` (the agreement
  programs), `test/constant_time/Jamfile`, `doc/backends.adoc`, `doc/jamfile.adoc`,
  `doc/memory.adoc`, `README.md`; (superproject) the fixture
  `tools/test/fixtures/crypto_jamfiles/botan/` (a user's Botan program), `tools/ci/matrix.py`
  and `tools/ci/matrix_test.py` (the lane `constant-time` needs `botan`).

- [ ] **Step 1: Agreement** (spec 8.2): `agree_gcm<bearssl, botan>`, `agree_gcm<openssl, botan>`,
  `agree_chacha<bearssl, botan>`, `agree_chacha<openssl, botan>`, and the block cipher's
  ctaes, OpenSSL and Botan, in `test/botan/` with `<exception-handling>on`, natively.
- [ ] **Step 1a: Botan in the constant-time checks** (spec 8.3, "every backend", m14), each
  written first and seen failing (no file):
  - `test/constant_time/ctgrind_botan_test.cpp`, Task 20's ctgrind form: the seal of
    `gcm<aes256<botan>>` and of `chacha20_poly1305<botan>` with the key and the plaintext
    marked undefined, and memcheck reporting nothing; the open is left out of it and the
    test's comment says why, as for OpenSSL (I8): Botan checks the tag inside itself and
    throws on a failure, a branch on the verdict that webcpp cannot declassify (Botan's own
    `CT::unpoison` exists only in a Botan configured `--with-valgrind`, which neither the
    system's nor Homebrew's is); its planted leak behind `WEBCPP_TEST_CRYPTO_PLANTED_LEAK`,
    as Task 20's, in a one-line twin `ctgrind_botan_planted_test.cpp`
    (`#include "ctgrind_botan_test.cpp"`), so a memcheck that sees nothing fails;
  - `test/constant_time/dudect_botan_test.cpp`, Task 20's dudect form through `twice`, under
    the threshold 10: the seal of both AEADs, two classes of keys drawn alike (m7), and the
    open of both, two failing classes (I9), which measures the whole of Botan's failed open,
    its exception included;
  - in `test/constant_time/Jamfile`, Task 20's forms with
    `<library>/third_party//botan <exception-handling>on` added (the rest of that Jamfile
    keeps exceptions off): `webcpp.drive ctgrind_botan` and `ctgrind_botan_planted` (the
    second with `--expect-leak`) through `valgrind.mjs`, and `webcpp.run dudect_botan`, each
    `native`, the three added to the `constant-time` lane's list; `matrix.py`'s
    `EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCIES` gives the lane `botan` beside `openssl`, and its `matrix_test.py`
    case says so;
  - `doc/backends.adoc`'s Botan section states what is checked (the seal under Valgrind,
    seal and open by timing) and what is not (the open under Valgrind).
  Run the lane `constant-time` on a Linux machine with valgrind (Task 20's Step 5).
  Expected: PASS, and the planted leak's twin failing as it should.
- [ ] **Step 2: A user's Botan program**, the fixture `tools/test/fixtures/crypto_jamfiles/botan/`
  (`exe app : app.cpp /webcpp/crypto//crypto /third_party//botan : <exception-handling>on ;`,
  outcome `root: BOTAN_ROOT`, `requires: botan`,
  spec 7.2's `app.cpp`, printing `aes256_gcm ok backend=botan` natively, the default when Botan
  is the only AEAD backend linked).
- [ ] **Step 3: The page:** Botan's row and section in `doc/backends.adoc` (spec 3.6 for a
  user: found, native only for now, exceptions only, its errors mapped, the additional data on
  every message, its allocation outside the user's allocator with no hook that could route it
  and why, measured counts from `allocation_botan_test`), its messages in `doc/jamfile.adoc`,
  and `doc/memory.adoc`'s line that Botan keeps the departure.
- [ ] **Step 4: Run the definition of green** (Task 25's list, Botan's lanes with it), the
  review of increment 5 with the Review Focus, its fixes, and G4's push, with the owner's
  agreement.
