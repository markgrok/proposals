## Why

A C++ program on the web needs cryptography that Boost does not provide: authenticated
encryption of messages, a random number source it can trust, a constant-time comparison of tags,
and secp256k1 signatures. Boost.Hash2 covers hashing and HMAC, and nothing else. Every program
of webcpp that needs the rest (webcpp::trystero seals its signalling messages with AES-GCM and
signs Nostr events with BIP340 Schnorr) has so far carried its own code: a sealer for the
native build, another for the browser, a call to the browser's WebCrypto behind a promise, an
external libsecp256k1 and a direct use of OpenSSL.

webcpp needs one library that runs the same C++ on every target it has (native on Linux, macOS
and Windows, wasip2, wasip3 and Emscripten), whose algorithms are the proven C libraries
themselves and not webcpp's own port of them, whose errors are values, that allocates nothing
in the program's way, and that stops a wrong build with an instruction instead of a linker
puzzle. The owner decided its shape on 2026-10-10 and 2026-10-11, approved its specification on
2026-10-11, and it has a plan of 43 tasks in five increments. Nothing is built: the library's
repository has no commit.

## What Changes

- **New library `webcpp::crypto`**, a wrapper (webcpp's interface over other libraries),
  header-only C++20, with five increments:
  1. the foundation and AES-GCM on BearSSL and OpenSSL: `config.hpp`, `error`, `equal`,
     `random_device`, `aes128/192/256`, `gcm<Cipher>` (one shot and an incremental seal),
     OpenSSL's memory functions as an option of the config, the C libraries' build, the three
     layers that stop a wrong build, the tests, sizes and throughput, the documentation;
  2. libsecp256k1 and ctaes: `secp256k1::keypair`, `verify_schnorr`, `verify_ecdsa`, ECDH, and
     the AES block cipher on ctaes;
  3. webcpp::trystero moved onto `aes256_gcm`, `random_device` and `secp256k1::keypair`;
  4. ChaCha20-Poly1305 on BearSSL and OpenSSL;
  5. Botan, found on the machine, native only, with exceptions only.
- **The interface is shaped as Boost.Hash2's:** algorithm types with `static constexpr` sizes,
  modes as templates over a cipher (`gcm<aes256<>>`), tags as `boost::hash2::digest<16>`, and
  the backend a template parameter whose default `config.hpp` chooses per target. Where Hash2
  cannot be followed, a keyed object is made by `static make(...)`, which returns
  `boost::system::result<T>`.
- **Backends are the C libraries themselves** (BearSSL, OpenSSL, ctaes, libsecp256k1) and
  Botan, never a port. BearSSL, libsecp256k1 and ctaes are built from their own sources, file
  by file, by the superproject's `third_party/Jamfile`; OpenSSL and Botan are found on the
  machine. A program names `/webcpp/crypto//crypto` and `/third_party//<backend>` in its own
  Jamfile.
- **A wrong build stops with an instruction,** in three layers: a compile-time `#error` or
  `static_assert` that says exactly what to add, a link-time canary symbol whose name is the
  instruction, and `#pragma detect_mismatch` on MSVC.
- **The default backend is the smallest binary on the web and the fastest on servers:** BearSSL
  on WebAssembly, OpenSSL natively when linked, BearSSL natively otherwise.
- **Entropy always takes the safest path:** one source per platform (`getentropy`, or
  `BCryptGenRandom` on Windows), no generator in user space, no weaker fallback.
- **OpenSSL's memory functions are an option of the config:** with
  `WEBCPP_CRYPTO_OPENSSL_MEMORY_RESOURCE` a program names a `std::pmr::memory_resource` and
  every allocation of OpenSSL in the process goes to it. Without the option OpenSSL's and
  Botan's `make` allocate outside the program's allocator, a departure the owner accepted.
- **BREAKING for webcpp::trystero (increment 3):** its `sealer` and `make_sealer`, its native
  and browser sealers and its `random` that aborts when the system has no entropy are replaced
  by `aes256_gcm` and `random_device::fill`, which reports `entropy_unavailable`; its external
  libsecp256k1 is replaced by `/third_party//secp256k1`.
- **The superproject gains** the second project id `/third_party`, the incidental feature
  `webcpp-own`, `webcpp.external-root` and `webcpp.external-looked`, the rule
  `webcpp.same-program`, a Python test of the tools that builds the user's Jamfiles as fixtures,
  lint rules on the entropy header and the canary's pins, NIST's test archives pinned by URL and
  SHA-256, and the nightly level of the CI's own lanes.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `crypto`: webcpp::crypto, authenticated encryption (AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305), the AES
  block cipher, a `random_device`, a constant-time `equal` and secp256k1 (BIP340, ECDSA, ECDH)
  over C backends, with its interface, error values, backends, build, default backend per
  target, entropy rule, OpenSSL memory option, tests, documentation and increments.

### Modified Capabilities

None.

## Impact

- **Kind:** a wrapper (`"port-of": null`): webcpp's interface over BearSSL, OpenSSL, ctaes,
  libsecp256k1 and Botan, none of which is ported. Repository `webcpporg/crypto` (not created;
  the owner creates it, plan gate G1), checked out as the submodule `libs/crypto` (gate G2),
  BSL-1.0, "Copyright (c) 2026 WebCpp.org".
- **Implementation:** not started. The library's repository has no commit and no file.
  **The reference code is the code written in the tasks of `reference/plan.md`:** Task 1
  (the skeleton, `build.jam`, the test Jamfile's `crypto-run`), Task 2 (`error.hpp`), Task 3
  (`equal.hpp`, `detail/wipe.hpp`), Task 4 (`random_device.hpp`, `detail/entropy.hpp`,
  `detail/windows.hpp`), Task 5 (`third_party/Jamfile` for BearSSL, `canary_bearssl.c`,
  `detail/canary.h`), Task 6 (`config.hpp`, `backends/bearssl.hpp`, the message tests), Tasks 7
  and 8 (`aes.hpp`, `gcm.hpp`), Task 12 (`backends/openssl.hpp`), Task 14 (`aes256_gcm.hpp`),
  Task 15 (the memory adapter), Task 27 (`secp256k1.hpp`), Task 29 (`backends/ctaes.hpp`), Task
  35 (`chacha20_poly1305.hpp`) and Task 38 (`backends/botan.hpp`), with the tests, Jamfiles and
  tools the other tasks give. `reference/spec.md` is the full specification and
  `reference/STATUS.md` says where things stand and how to resume.
- **Dependencies:** Boost 1.92 (System, Hash2, Core's `lightweight_test`, JSON in tests);
  BearSSL at `7bea48e5e850ab4cafbe68d3765cdaba13a86d6f` from the mirror `webcpporg/bearssl`
  (MIT); libsecp256k1 v0.8.0 (MIT); ctaes as Bitcoin Core v31.1 ships it (MIT); OpenSSL 3.0 or
  later, found on the machine (Apache-2.0); Botan 3 (3.13.0 measured), found on the machine
  (BSD-2-Clause); for tests, Wycheproof, BIP340's test vectors, NIST CAVP's archives, Valgrind,
  MemorySanitizer, wasmtime, node and Chrome. The superproject's `tools/webcpp.jam`,
  `third_party/Jamfile` and the asio track's test support (`webcpp::test::exit_status`).
- **Status:** accepted on 2026-10-11 (the owner approved the specification); not built, no
  release.
- **Other proposals:** `libraries/trystero` is changed by increment 3 (its sealer, entropy and
  signer move onto this library) and must have integrated its shared-connection change first;
  `libraries/asio` moves its OpenSSL onto `/third_party//openssl` in Task 25a and supplies the
  test support every test here uses; `libraries/webrtc` and `libraries/beast` may use this
  library later; `organization` carries the superproject's rulebook and CI levels these tasks
  extend.
