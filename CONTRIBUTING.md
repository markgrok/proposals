# Contributing a proposal

webcpp grows by proposals. A library, or a change to one, enters webcpp only after its proposal
is accepted here, and it is built from that proposal. This page says what a proposal is, how to
submit one, and how it is decided.

## Read first

1. The organization's genesis, `organization/openspec/changes/archive/*-genesis/` and
   `organization/openspec/specs/`: how webcpp is organized, built, documented, tested and
   released, and what every library must be. A proposal that does not fit it is not accepted.
2. The superproject's [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/webcpporg/webcpp/blob/main/AGENTS.md), the
   rulebook every library follows.
3. One finished proposal of the kind you write: `libraries/lexical/openspec/changes/` holds a
   genesis (implemented) and a change (draft); `libraries/json_schema/openspec/changes/genesis/`
   a new library partly built.

## Kinds of library

| Kind | What it is | What proves it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `own` | A design of webcpp's own. | Its specification, its tests and the references it cites (RFCs, standards). |
| `port` | A port of another project, faithful to a pinned version of it (`port_of`). | That project, run as an oracle against the port where it can be. |
| `wrapper` | webcpp's interface over another library, or over the platform. | The wrapped library's own behaviour, on every target webcpp builds for. |

## A new library, or a change

- **A new library** is proposed by its genesis: a new directory `libraries/<name>/` with an
  OpenSpec root, and the proposal in `libraries/<name>/openspec/changes/genesis/`, whose
  requirements add a capability named after the library.
- **A change to an existing library** is a proposal in that library's root,
  `libraries/<name>/openspec/changes/<change-id>/`, whose requirements add to or modify the
  library's capability. Its id says what it changes (`shared-connection`, `strategies`).
- A change to the organization itself (the superproject, its build, its rules, the site) is a
  proposal in `organization/openspec/changes/<change-id>/`.

## What a proposal holds

- `proposal.md`: `## Why`, `## What Changes`, `## Capabilities`, `## Impact` (with **Kind**,
  **Implementation** and **Status**).
- `design.md`: the context, goals and non-goals, the decisions with the alternatives rejected,
  the risks, the migration and the open questions.
- `tasks.md`: the work, in groups, each task small enough to review.
- `specs/<capability>/spec.md`: requirements (`### Requirement:`, a SHALL or MUST), each with
  scenarios (`#### Scenario:`, WHEN and THEN).
- `.openspec.yaml`: the metadata the index reads (`library`, `title`, `kind`, `port_of`,
  `status`, `release`, `implementation`, `decided`).
- `reference/`: **the reference code an implementer starts from**, which every proposal carries
  before it is proposed (a prototype, the code of a plan's tasks, or the library's tree), its
  original specification and plan when there are any, and `STATUS.md`.

Everything is written in English, without the em dash. A proposal names no person but by the
identity they publish under, and holds no private data.

## How a proposal is decided

1. **Open a pull request** that adds the proposal, with status `draft` while it is written and
   `proposed` when it is ready, and the link to the repository where its implementation lives or
   will live. The CI checks it (`tools/proposals.py check` and OpenSpec's strict validation).
2. **Discussion** happens in public, on the pull request.
3. **Decision.** The maintainers decide whether a proposal is accepted, after its public
   discussion; an accepted proposal is merged with status `accepted` and its date in `decided`.
   A rejected or withdrawn one is archived with that status, so the reasons stay readable.
4. **Implementation.** The library is built from the proposal, in its own repository, under the
   superproject's rules; the proposal's status becomes `implementing`, and `implemented`, with
   the release it entered, when it is merged into the superproject and released. The maintainers
   then archive it, which writes the library's specification under `specs/`.

## Grants and the DAO

webcpp funds work through grants governed by its members. The governance, its rules and the
platform it runs on are described at webcpp.org/dao, which a future proposal of the
organization specifies. Until then, proposals are decided by the maintainers as above.

## Checking a proposal locally

```
npm install --global @fission-ai/openspec@1.10.0
cd libraries/<name> && openspec validate --all --strict --no-interactive
cd ../.. && python3 tools/proposals.py readme && python3 tools/proposals.py check
```
